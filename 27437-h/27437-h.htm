<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A PAIR OF BLUE EYES</h3>
</div>

<p>In the estimate of the affable brakeman (a gentleman
wearing sky-blue army pantaloons tucked into
cowhide boots, half-buttoned vest, flannel shirt open
at the throat, and upon his red hair a flaring-brimmed
black slouch hat) we were making a fair average of
twenty miles an hour across the greatest country on
earth. It was a flat country of far horizons, and for
vast stretches peopled mainly, as one might judge
from the car windows, by antelope and the equally
curious rodents styled prairie dogs.</p>
<p>Yet despite the novelty of such a ride into that
unknown new West now being spanned at giant&#8217;s
strides by the miraculous Pacific Railway, behold me,
surfeited with already five days&#8217; steady travel,
engrossed chiefly in observing a clear, dainty profile
and waiting for the glimpses, time to time, of a pair
of exquisite blue eyes.</p>
<p>Merely to indulge myself in feminine beauty, however,
I need not have undertaken the expense and
fatigue of journeying from Albany on the Hudson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
out to Omaha on the plains side of the Missouri
River; thence by the Union Pacific Railroad of the
new transcontinental line into the Indian country.
There were handsome women a-plenty in the East; and
of access, also, to a youth of family and parts. I had
pictures of the same in my social register. A man
does not attain to twenty-five years without having
accomplished a few pages of the heart book. Nevertheless
all such pages were&mdash;or had seemed to be&mdash;wholly
retrospective now, for here I was, advised by
the physicians to &#8220;go West,&#8221; meaning by this not
simply the one-time West of Ohio, or Illinois, or even
Iowa, but the remote and genuine West lying beyond
the Missouri.</p>
<p>Whereupon, out of desperation that flung the
gauntlet down to hope I had taken the bull by the
horns in earnest. West should be full dose, at the utmost
procurable by modern conveyance.</p>
<p>The Union Pacific announcements acclaimed that
this summer of 1868 the rails should cross the Black
Hills Mountains of Wyoming to another range of the
Rocky Mountains, in Utah; and that by the end of
the year one might ride comfortably clear to Salt
Lake City. Certainly this was &#8220;going West&#8221; with
a vengeance; but as appeared to me&mdash;and to my father
and mother and the physicians&mdash;somewhere in
the expanse of brand new Western country, the plains
and mountains, I would find at least the breath of
life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>When I arrived in Omaha the ticket agent was enabled
to sell me transportation away to the town of
Benton, Wyoming Territory itself, six hundred and
ninety miles (he said) west of the Missouri.</p>
<p>Of Benton I had never heard. It was upon no
public maps, as yet. But in round figures, seven hundred
miles! Practically the distance from Albany to
Cincinnati, and itself distant from Albany over two
thousand miles! All by rail.</p>
<p>Benton was, he explained, the present end of passenger
service, this August. In another month&mdash;and
he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fact is, while you&#8217;re standing here,&#8221; he alleged,
&#8220;I may get orders any moment to sell a longer ticket.
The Casements are laying two to three miles of track
a day, seven days in the week, and stepping right on
the heels of the graders. Last April we were selling
only to Cheyenne, rising of five hundred miles. Then
in May we began to sell to Laramie, five hundred and
seventy-six miles. Last of July we began selling to
Benton, a hundred and twenty miles farther. Track&#8217;s
now probably fifty or more miles west of Benton and
there&#8217;s liable to be another passenger terminus to-morrow.
So it might pay you to wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Thank you, but I&#8217;ll try Benton.
I can go on from there as I think best. Could you
recommend local accommodations?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared, through the bars of the little window
behind which lay a six-chambered revolver.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Could I do what, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Recommend a hotel, at Benton where I&#8217;m going.
There is a hotel, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he exclaimed testily. &#8220;In a city
of three thousand people? A hotel? A dozen of
&#8217;em, but I don&#8217;t know their names. What do you
expect to find in Benton? You&#8217;re from the East, I
take it. Going out on spec&#8217;, or pleasure, or health?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been advised to try Western air for a
change,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I am looking for some place
that is high, and dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumption, eh?&#8221; he shrewdly remarked.
&#8220;High and dry; that&#8217;s it. Oh, yes; you&#8217;ll find Benton
high enough, and toler&#8217;bly dry. You bet! And
nobody dies natural, at Benton, they say. Here&#8217;s
your ticket. Thank you. And the change. Next,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did not take me long to gather the change remaining
from seventy dollars greenbacks swapped for
six hundred and ninety miles of travel at ten cents a
mile. I hastily stepped aside. A subtle fragrance
and a rustle warned me that I was obstructing a
representative of the fair sex. So did the smirk and
smile of the ticket agent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your pardon, madam,&#8221; I proffered, lifting my
hat&mdash;agreeably dazzled while thus performing.</p>
<p>She acknowledged the tribute with a faint blush.
While pocketing my change and stowing away my
ticket I had opportunity to survey her further.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Benton,&#8221; she said briefly, to the agent.</p>
<p>We were bound for the same point, then. Ye gods,
but she was a little beauty: a perfect blonde, of the
petite and fully formed type, with regular features
inclined to the clean-cut Grecian, a piquant mouth
deliciously bowed, two eyes of the deepest blue veiled
by long lashes, and a mass of glinting golden hair
upon which perched a ravishing little bonnet. The
natural ensemble was enhanced by her costume, all of
black, from the closely fitting bodice to the rustling
crinoline beneath which there peeped out tiny shoes.
I had opportunity also to note the jet pendant in the
shelly ear toward me, and the flashing rings upon the
fingers of her hands, ungloved in order to sort out the
money from her reticule.</p>
<p>Sooth to say, I might not stand there gawking.
Once, by a demure sideways glance, she betrayed
knowledge of my presence. Her own transaction was
all matter-of-fact, as if engaging passage to Benton of
Wyoming Territory contained no novelty for her.
Could she by any chance live there&mdash;a woman dressed
like she was, as much à la mode as if she walked
Broadway in New York? Omaha itself had astonished
me with the display upon its streets; and now if
Benton, far out in the wilderness, should prove
another surprise&mdash;&mdash;! Indeed, the Western world
was not so raw, after all. Strange to say, as soon as
one crossed the Missouri River one began to sense
romance, and to discover it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>As seemed to me, the ticket agent would have
detained her, in defiance of the waiting line; but she
finished her business shortly, with shorter replies to
his idle remarks; and I turned away under pretense of
examining some placards upon the wall advertising
&#8220;Platte Valley lands&#8221; for sale. I had curiosity to
see which way she wended. Then as she tripped for
the door, casting eyes never right nor left, and still
fumbling at her reticule, a coin slipped from her
fingers and rolled, by good fortune, across the floor.</p>
<p>I was after it instantly; caught it, and with best
bow presented it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Permit me, madam.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment she paused to restore it to its company;
and I grasped the occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon. You are going to Benton, of
Wyoming Territory?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes met mine so completely as well-nigh to
daze me with their glory. There was a quizzical uplift
in her frank, arch smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, sir. To Benton City, of Wyoming Territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are acquainted there?&#8221; I ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I am acquainted there. And you are
from Benton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; I assured. &#8220;I am from New York
State.&#8221; As if anybody might not have known.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
&#8220;But I have just purchased my ticket to Benton,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I stammered, &#8220;I have made bold to wonder
if you would not have the goodness to tell me
something of the place&mdash;as to accommodations, and
all that. You don&#8217;t by any chance happen to live
there, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not, sir, may I ask?&#8221; she challenged.</p>
<p>I floundered before her query direct, and her bewildering
eyes and lips&mdash;all tantalizing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know&mdash;I had no idea&mdash;Wyoming Territory
has been mentioned in the newspapers as
largely Indian country&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At Benton we are only six days behind New York
fashions,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;You have not been out over
the railroad, then, I suspect. Not to North Platte?
Nor to Cheyenne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never been west of Cincinnati before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have surely been reading of the railroad?
The Pacific Railway between the East and California?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. In fact, a friend of mine, named
Stephen Clark, nephew of the Honorable Thurlow
Weed formerly of Albany, was killed a year ago by
your Indians while surveying west of the Black Hills.
And of course there have been accounts in the New
York papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not on survey service? Or possibly,
yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, madam.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A pleasure trip to end of track?&#8221;</p>
<p>She evidently was curious, but I was getting accustomed
to questions into private matters. That was
the universal license, out here.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pleasure of finding health,&#8221; I laughed. &#8220;I
have been advised to seek a location high and dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She dimpled adorably. &#8220;I congratulate
you on your choice. You will make no mistake, then,
in trying Benton. I can promise you that it is high
and reasonably dry. And as for accommodations&mdash;so
far as I have ever heard anybody is accommodated
there with whatever he may wish.&#8221; She darted a
glance at me; stepped aside as if to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am to understand that it is a city?&#8221; I pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Benton? Why, certainly. All the world is
flowing to Benton. We gained three thousand people
in two weeks&mdash;much to the sorrow of poor old
Cheyenne and Laramie. No doubt there are five
thousand people there now, and all busy. Yes, a
young man will find his opportunities in Benton. I
think your choice will please you. Money is plentiful,
and so are the chances to spend it.&#8221; She bestowed
upon me another sparkling glance. &#8220;And since we
are both going to Benton I will say &#8217;Au revoir,&#8217; sir.&#8221;
She left me quivering.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do live there?&#8221; I besought, after; and received
a nod of the golden head as she entered the
sacred Ladies&#8217; Waiting Room.</p>
<p>Until the train should be made up I might only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
stroll, restless and strangely buoyed, with that vision
of an entrancing fellow traveler filling my eyes.
Summoned in due time by the clamor &#8220;Passengers
for the Pacific Railway! All aboard, going west on
the Union Pacific!&#8221; here amidst the platform hurly-burly
of men, women, children and bundles I had the
satisfaction to sight the black-clad figure of My Lady
of the Blue Eyes; hastening, like the rest, but not unattended&mdash;for
a brakeman bore her valise and the
conductor her parasol. The scurrying crowd gallantly
parted before her. It as promptly closed upon her
wake; try as I might I was utterly unable to keep in
her course.</p>
<p>Obviously, the train was to be well occupied.
Carried on willy-nilly I mounted the first steps at
hand; elbowed on down the aisle until I managed to
squirm aside into a vacant seat. The remaining half
was at once effectually filled by a large, stout, red-faced
woman who formed the base of a pyramid of
boxes and parcels.</p>
<p>My neighbor, who blocked all egress, was going to
North Platte, three hundred miles westward, I
speedily found out. And she almost as speedily
learned that I was going to Benton.</p>
<p>She stared, round-eyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re a gambler, young man,&#8221; she
accused.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, madam. Do I look like a gambler?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell by looks, young man,&#8221; she asserted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
still suspicious, &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re on spec&#8217;, then, in
some other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am seeking health in the West, is all, where the
climate is high and dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My Gawd!&#8221; she blurted. &#8220;High and dry!
You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to the right place. For all I hear tell,
Benton is high enough and dry enough. Are your
eye-teeth peeled, young man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My eye-teeth?&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;I hope so, madam.
Are eye-teeth necessary in Benton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peeled, and with hair on &#8217;em, young man,&#8221; she
assured. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re a pilgrim, ain&#8217;t you? I see
a leetle green in your eye. No, you ain&#8217;t a tin-horn.
You&#8217;re some mother&#8217;s boy, jest gettin&#8217; away from the
trough. My sakes! Sick, too, eh? Weak lungs,
ain&#8217;t it? Now you tell me: Why you goin&#8217; to Benton?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an inviting kindness in her query.
Plainly she had a good heart, large in proportion with
her other bulk.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the farthest point west that I can reach by
railroad, and everybody I have talked with has recommended
it as high and dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; she nodded; and chuckled fatly. &#8220;But
laws sakes, you don&#8217;t need to go that fur. You can
as well stop off at North Platte, or Sidney or Cheyenne.
They&#8217;ll sculp you sure at Benton, unless you
watch out mighty sharp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How so, may I ask?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re certainly green,&#8221; she apprised. &#8220;Benton&#8217;s
roarin&#8217;&mdash;and I know what that means. Didn&#8217;t
North Platte roar? I seen it at its beginnin&#8217;s. My
old man and me, we were there from the fust, when
it started in as the railroad terminal. My sakes, but
them were times! What with the gamblin&#8217; and the
shootin&#8217; and the drinkin&#8217; and the high-cockalorums
night and day, &#8217;twasn&#8217;t no place for innocence. Easy
come, easy go, that was the word. I don&#8217;t say but
what times were good, though. My old man contracted
government freight, and I run an eatin&#8217; house
for the railroaders, so we made money. Then when
the railroad moved terminus, the wust of the crowd
moved, too, and us others who stayed turned North
Platte into a strictly moral town. But land sakes!
North Platte in its roarin&#8217; days wasn&#8217;t no place for a
young man like you. Neither was Julesburg, or Sidney,
or Cheyenne, when they was terminuses. And I
hear tell Benton is wuss&#8217;n all rolled into one. Young
man, now listen: You stop off at North Platte, Nebrasky.
It&#8217;s healthy and it&#8217;s moral, and it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to
make Omyha look like a shinplaster. I&#8217;ll watch after
you. Maybe I can get you a job in my man&#8217;s store.
You&#8217;ve j&#8217;ined some church, I reckon? Now if you&#8217;re
a Baptist&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>But since I had crossed the Missouri something had
entered into my blood which rendered me obstinate
against such allurements. For her North Platte,
&#8220;strictly moral,&#8221; and the guardianship of her broad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
motherly wing I had no ardent feeling. I was set
upon Benton; foolishly, fatuously set. And in after
days&mdash;soon to arrive&mdash;I bitterly regretted that I had
not yielded to her wholesome, honest counsel.</p>
<p>Nevertheless this was true, at present:</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have already purchased my ticket to Benton,&#8221;
I objected. &#8220;I understand that I shall find the
proper climate there, and suitable accommodations.
And if I don&#8217;t like it I can move elsewhere. Possibly
to Salt Lake City, or Denver.&#8221;</p>
<p>She snorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;In among them Mormons? My Gawd, young
man! Where they live in conkibinage&mdash;several
women to one man, like a buffler herd or other beasts
of the field? I guess your mother never heard you
talk like that. Denver&mdash;well, Denver mightn&#8217;t be bad,
though I do hear tell that folks nigh starve to death
there, what with the Injuns and the snow. Denver
ain&#8217;t on no railroad, either. If you want health, and
to grow up with a strictly moral community, you
throw in with North Platte of Nebrasky, the great
and growin&#8217; city of the Plains. I reckon you&#8217;ve heard
of North Platte, even where you come from. You
take my word for it, and exchange your ticket.&#8221;</p>
<p>It struck me here that the good woman might not
be unbiased in her fondness for North Platte. To
extol the present and future of these Western towns
seemed a fixed habit. During my brief stay in
Omaha&mdash;yes, on the way across Illinois and Iowa
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
from Chicago, I had encountered this peculiar trait.
Iowa was rife with aspiring if embryonic metropolises.
Now in Nebraska, Columbus was destined to be
the new national capital and the center of population
for the United States; Fremont was lauded as one of
the great railroad junctions of the world; and North
Platte, three hundred miles out into the plains, was
proclaimed as the rival of Omaha, and &#8220;strictly
moral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;But since I&#8217;ve started
for Benton I think I&#8217;ll go on. And if I don&#8217;t like it
or it doesn&#8217;t agree with me you may see me in North
Platte after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She grunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can find me at the Bon Ton restaurant. If
you get in broke, I&#8217;ll take care of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that she settled herself comfortably. In remarkably
short order she was asleep and snoring.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>TO BETTER ACQUAINTANCE</h3>
</div>

<p>The train had started amidst clangor of bell and
the shouts of good-bye and good-luck from the crowd
upon the station platform. We had rolled out
through train yards occupied to the fullest by car
shops, round house, piled-up freight depot, stacks of
ties and iron, and tracks covered with freight cars
loaded high to rails, ties, baled hay, all manner and
means of supplies designed, I imagined, for the building
operations far in the West.</p>
<p>Soon we had left this busy Train Town behind, and
were entering the open country. The landscape was
pleasing, but the real sights probably lay ahead; so I
turned from my window to examine my traveling
quarters.</p>
<p>The coach&mdash;a new one, built in the company&#8217;s shops
and decidedly upon a par with the very best coaches
of the Eastern roads&mdash;was jammed; every seat taken.
I did not see My Lady of the Blue Eyes, nor her
equal, but almost the whole gamut of society was
represented: Farmers, merchants, a few soldiers,
plainsmen in boots and flannel shirt-sleeves and long
hair and large hats, with revolvers hanging from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
racks above them or from the seat ends; one or two
white-faced gentry in broadcloth and patent-leather
shoes&mdash;who I fancied might be gamblers such as now
and then plied their trade upon the Hudson River
boats; two Indians in blankets; Eastern tourists, akin
to myself; women and children of country type; and
so forth. What chiefly caught my eye were the carbines
racked against the ends of the coach, for protection
in case of Indians or highwaymen, no doubt.
I observed bottles being passed from hand to hand,
and tilted en route. The amount and frequency of
the whiskey for consumption in this country were astonishing.</p>
<p>My friend snored peacefully. Near noon we halted
for dinner at the town of Fremont, some fifty miles
out. She awakened at the general stir, and when I
squeezed by her she immediately fished for a packet of
lunch. We had thirty minutes at Fremont&mdash;ample
time in which to discuss a very excellent meal of
antelope steaks, prairie fowl, fried potatoes and hot
biscuits. There was promise of buffalo meat farther
on, possibly at the next meal station, Grand Island.</p>
<p>The time was sufficient, also, to give me another
glimpse of My Lady of the Blue Eyes, who appeared
to have been awarded the place of honor between the
conductor and the brakeman, at table. She bestowed
upon me a subtle glance of recognition&mdash;with a smile
and a slight bow in one; but I failed to find her upon
the station platform after the meal. That I should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
obtain other opportunities I did not doubt. Benton
was yet thirty hours&#8217; travel.</p>
<p>All that afternoon we rocked along up the Platte
Valley, with the Platte River&mdash;a broad but shallow
stream&mdash;constantly upon our left. My seat companion
evidently had exhausted her repertoire, for
she slumbered at ease, gradually sinking into a shapeless
mass, her flowered bonnet askew. Several other
passengers also were sleeping; due, in part, to the
whiskey bottles. The car was thinning out, I noted,
and I might bid in advance for the chance of obtaining
a new location in a certain car ahead.</p>
<p>The scenery through the car window had merged
into a monotony accentuated by great spaces. As far
as Fremont the country along the railroad had been
well settled with farms and unfenced cultivated fields.
Now we had issued into the untrammeled prairies,
here and there humanized by an isolated shack or a
lonely traveler by horse or wagon, but in the main a
vast sun-baked dead sea of gentle, silent undulations
extending, brownish, clear to the horizons. The only
refreshing sights were the Platte River, flowing blue
and yellow among sand-bars and islands, and the side
streams that we passed. Close at hand the principal
tokens of life were the little flag stations, and the
tremendous freight trains side-tracked to give us the
right of way. The widely separated hamlets where
we impatiently stopped were the oases in the desert.</p>
<p>In the sunset we halted at the supper station, named
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
Grand Island. My seat neighbor finished her lunch
box, and I returned well fortified by another excellent
meal at the not exorbitant price, one dollar and
a quarter. There had been buffalo meat&mdash;a poor
apology, to my notion, for good beef. Antelope
steak, on the contrary, was of far finer flavor than the
best mutton.</p>
<p>At Grand Island a number of wretched native Indians
drew my attention, for the time being, from
quest of My Lady of the Blue Eyes. However, she
was still escorted by the conductor, who in his brass
buttons and officious air began to irritate me. Such
a persistent squire of dames rather overstepped the
duties of his position. Confound the fellow! He
surely would come to the end of his run and his rope
before we went much farther.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, young man, if you get shet of your foolishness
and decide to try North Platte instead of some
fly-by-night town on west,&#8221; my seat companion addressed,
&#8220;you jest follow me when I leave. We get
to North Platte after plumb dark, and you hang onto
my skirts right up town, till I land you in a good
place. For if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re liable to be skinned
alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I decide upon North Platte I certainly will take
advantage of your kindness,&#8221; I evaded. Forsooth,
she had a mind to kidnap me!</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; sensible,&#8221; she approved.
&#8220;My sakes alive! Benton!&#8221; And she sniffed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
&#8220;Why, in Benton they&#8217;ll snatch you bald-headed &#8217;fore
you&#8217;ve been there an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>She composed herself for another nap.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that pesky brakeman don&#8217;t remember to wake
me, you give me a poke with your elbow. I wouldn&#8217;t
be carried beyond North Platte for love or money.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gurgled, she snored. The sunset was fading
from pink to gold&mdash;a gold like somebody&#8217;s hair; and
from gold to lemon which tinted all the prairie and
made it beautiful. Pursuing the sunset we steadily
rumbled westward through the immensity of unbroken
space.</p>
<p>The brakeman came in, lighting the coal-oil lamps.
Outside, the twilight had deepened into dusk. Numerous
passengers were making ready for bed: the
men by removing their boots and shoes and coats and
galluses and stretching out; the women by loosening
their stays, with significant clicks and sighs, and laying
their heads upon adjacent shoulders or drooping
against seat ends. Babies cried, and were hushed.
Final night-caps were taken, from the prevalent bottles.</p>
<p>The brakeman, returning, paused and inquired
right and left on his way through. He leaned to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;You for North Platte?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. Benton, Wyoming Territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better move up to the car ahead.
This car stops at North Platte.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What time do we reach North Platte?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Two-thirty in the morning. If you don&#8217;t want to
be waked up, you&#8217;d better change now. You&#8217;ll find
a seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that I gladly followed him out. He indicated a
half-empty seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gentleman gets off a bit farther on; then
you&#8217;ll have the seat to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The arrangement was satisfactory, albeit the
&#8220;gentleman&#8221; with whom I shared appeared, to nose
and eyes, rather well soused, as they say; but fortune
had favored me&mdash;across the aisle, only a couple of
seats beyond, I glimpsed the top of a golden head,
securely low and barricaded in by luggage.</p>
<p>Without regrets I abandoned my former seat-mate
to her disappointment when she waked at North
Platte. This car was the place for me, set apart by
the salient presence of one person among all the
others. That, however, is apt to differentiate city
from city, and even land from land.</p>
<p>Eventually I, also, slept&mdash;at first by fits and starts
concomitant with railway travel by night, then more
soundly when the &#8220;gentleman,&#8221; my comrade in adventure,
had been hauled out and deposited elsewhere.
I fully awakened only at daylight.</p>
<p>The train was rumbling as before. The lamps had
been extinguished&mdash;the coach atmosphere was heavy
with oil smell and the exhalations of human beings
in all stages of deshabille. But the golden head was
there, about as when last sighted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>Now it stirred, and erected a little. I felt the unseemliness
of sitting and waiting for her to make her
toilet, so I hastily staggered to achieve my own by
aid of the water tank, tin basin, roller towel and small
looking-glass at the rear&mdash;substituting my personal
comb and brush for the pair hanging there by
cords.</p>
<p>The coach was the last in the train. I stepped out
upon the platform, for fresh air.</p>
<p>We were traversing the real plains of the Great
American Desert, I judged. The prairie grasses had
shortened to brown stubble interspersed with bare
sandy soil rising here and there into low hills. It
was a country without north, south, east, west, save
as denoted by the sun, broadly launching his first
beams of the day. Behind us the single track of
double rails stretched straight away as if clear to the
Missouri. The dull blare of the car wheels was the
only token of life, excepting the long-eared rabbits
scampering with erratic high jumps, and the prairie
dogs sitting bolt upright in the sunshine among their
hillocked burrows. Of any town there was no sign.
We had cut loose from company.</p>
<p>Then we thundered by a freight train, loaded with
still more ties and iron, standing upon a siding
guarded by the idling trainmen and by an operator&#8217;s
shack. Smoke was welling from the chimney of the
shack&mdash;and that domestic touch gave me a sense of
homesickness. Yet I would not have been home, even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
for breakfast. This wide realm of nowhere fascinated
with the unknown.</p>
<p>The train and shack flattened into the landscape.
A bevy of antelope flashed white tails at us as they
scudded away. Two motionless figures, horseback,
whom I took to be wild Indians, surveyed us from a
distant sand-hill. Across the river there appeared a
fungus of low buildings, almost indistinguishable,
with a glimmer of canvas-topped wagons fringing it.
That was the old emigrant road.</p>
<p>While I was thus orienting myself in lonesome
but not entirely hopeless fashion the car door opened
and closed. I turned my head. The Lady of the
Blue Eyes had joined me. As fresh as the morning
she was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! You? I beg your pardon, sir.&#8221; She apologized,
but I felt that the diffidence was more politic
than sincere.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are heartily welcome, madam,&#8221; I assured.
&#8220;There is air enough for us both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The car is suffocating,&#8221; she said. &#8220;However, the
worst is over. We shall not have to spend another
such a night. You are still for Benton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means.&#8221; And I bowed to her. &#8220;We are
fellow-travelers to the end, I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; She scanned me. &#8220;But I do not like
that word: the end. It is not a popular word, in the
West. Certainly not at Benton. For instance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>We tore by another freight waiting upon a siding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
located amidst a wide débris of tin cans, scattered
sheet-iron, stark mud-and-stone chimneys, and barren
spots, resembling the ruins from fire and quake.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is Julesburg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A town?&#8221; I gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;The end.&#8221; She smiled. &#8220;The only inhabitants
now are in the station-house and the graveyard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the others? Where are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Farther west. Many of them in Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed? Or in North Platte!&#8221; I bantered.</p>
<p>&#8220;North Platte!&#8221; She laughed merrily. &#8220;Dear
me, don&#8217;t mention North Platte&mdash;not in the same
breath with Benton, or even Cheyenne. A town of
hayseeds and dollar-a-day clerks whose height of
sport is to go fishing in the Platte! A young man
like you would die of ennui in North Platte. Julesburg
was a good town while it lasted. People <i>lived</i>,
there; and moved on because they wished to keep
alive. What is life, anyway, but a constant shuffle
of the cards? Oh, I should have laughed to see you
in North Platte.&#8221; And laugh she did. &#8220;You might
as well be dead underground as buried in one of those
smug seven-Sabbaths-a-week places.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her free speech accorded ill with what I had been
accustomed to in womankind; and yet became her
sparkling eyes and general dash.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be dead is past the joking, madam,&#8221; I reminded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. To be dead is the end. In Benton we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
live while we live, and don&#8217;t mention the end. So I
took exception to your gallantry.&#8221; She glanced behind
her, through the door window into the car.
&#8220;Will you,&#8221; she asked hastily, &#8220;join me in a little
appetizer, as they say? You will find it a superior
cognac&mdash;and we breakfast shortly, at Sidney.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a pocket of her skirt she had extracted a
small silver flask, stoppered with a tiny screw cup.
Her face swam before me, in my astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rarely drink liquor, madam,&#8221; I stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I. But when traveling&mdash;you know. And in
high and&mdash;dry Benton liquor is quite a necessity.
You will discover that, I am sure. You will not decline
to taste with a lady? Let us drink to better
acquaintance, in Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With all my heart, madam,&#8221; I blurted.</p>
<p>She poured, while swaying to the motion of the
train; passed the cup to me with a brightly challenging
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ladies first. That is the custom, is it not?&#8221; I
queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am hostess, sir. I do the honors. Pray do
you your duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To our better acquaintance, then, madam,&#8221; I accepted.
&#8220;In Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cognac swept down my throat like a stab of
hot oil. She poured for herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;A vôtre santé, monsieur&mdash;and continued beginnings,
no ends.&#8221; She daintily tossed it off.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>We had consummated our pledges just in time.
The brakeman issued, stumping noisily and bringing
discord into my heaven of blue and gold and comfortable
warmth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, lady and gent? Breakfast in twenty
minutes.&#8221; He grinned affably at her; yes, with a trace
of familiarity. &#8220;Sleep well, madam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Passably, thank you.&#8221; Her voice held a certain
element of calm interrogation as if to ask how far he
intended to push acquaintance. &#8220;We&#8217;re nearing Sidney,
you say? Then I bid you gentlemen good-morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a darting glance at him and a parting smile
for me she passed inside. The brakeman leaned
for an instant&#8217;s look ahead, up the track, and lingered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend of yours, is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I met her at Omaha, is all,&#8221; I stiffly informed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considerable of a dame, eh?&#8221; He eyed me.
&#8220;You&#8217;re booked for Benton, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never been there, myself. She&#8217;s another hell-roarer,
they say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221; I remonstrated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the town, the town,&#8221; he enlightened. &#8220;I&#8217;m
saying nothing against it, for that matter&mdash;nor
against her, either. They&#8217;re both O. K.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are acquainted with the lady, yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her? Sure. I know about everybody along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
line between Platte and Cheyenne. Been running on
this division ever since it opened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She lives in Benton, though, I understand,&#8221; I
proffered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes; sure she does. Moved there from
Cheyenne.&#8221; He looked at me queerly. &#8220;Naturally.
Ain&#8217;t that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably it is,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;I see no reason to
doubt your word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Followed her man. A heap of people
moved from Cheyenne to Benton, by way of Laramie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is married, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far as I know. Anyway, she&#8217;s not single, by a
long shot.&#8221; And he laughed. &#8220;But, Lord, that cuts
no great figger. People here don&#8217;t stand on ceremony
in those matters. Everything&#8217;s aboveboard.
Hands on the table until time to draw&mdash;then draw
quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>His language was a little too bluff for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her husband is in business, no doubt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Business?&#8221; He stared unblinking. &#8220;I see.&#8221;
He laid a finger alongside his nose, and winked
wisely. &#8220;You bet yuh! And good business. Yes,
siree. Are you on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I on?&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;On what? The
train?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, on your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Benton; certainly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see any green in my eye, friend?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or in the moon, maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nor in the moon,&#8221; I retorted. &#8220;But what is
all this about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be damned!&#8221; he roundly vouchsafed. And&mdash;&#8220;You&#8217;ve
been having a quiet little smile with her,
eh?&#8221; He sniffed suspiciously. &#8220;A few swigs of
that&#8217;ll make a pioneer of you quicker&#8217;n alkali. She&#8217;s
favoring you&mdash;eh? Now if she tells you of a system,
take my advice and quit while your hair&#8217;s long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My hair is my own fashion, sir,&#8221; I rebuked.
&#8220;And the lady is not for discussion between gentlemen,
particularly as my acquaintance with her is only
casual. I don&#8217;t understand your remarks, but if they
are insinuations I shall have to ask you to drop the
subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut!&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;No offense intended,
Mister Pilgrim. Well, you&#8217;re all right. We can&#8217;t be
young more than once, and if the lady takes you in
tow in Benton you&#8217;ll have the world by the tail as long
as it holds. She moves with the top-notchers; she&#8217;s a
knowing little piece&mdash;no offense. Her and me are
good enough friends. There&#8217;s no brace game in that
deal. I only aim to give you a steer. Savvy?&#8221; And
he winked. &#8220;You&#8217;re out to see the elephant, yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am seeking health, is all,&#8221; I explained. &#8220;My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
physician had advised a place in the Far West, high
and dry; and Benton is recommended.&#8221;</p>
<p>His response was identical with others preceding.</p>
<p>&#8220;High and dry? By golly, then Benton&#8217;s the
ticket. It&#8217;s sure high, and sure dry. You bet yuh!
High and dry and roaring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why &#8217;roaring&#8217;?&#8221; I demanded at last. The word
had been puzzling me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up and coming. Pop goes the weasel, at Benton.
Benton? Lord love you! They say it&#8217;s got Cheyenne
and Laramie backed up a tree, the best days they ever
seen. When you step off at Benton step lively and
keep an eye in the back of your head. There&#8217;s money
to be made at Benton, by the wise ones. Watch out
for ropers and if you get onto a system, play it.
There ain&#8217;t any limit to money or suckers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may not qualify as to money,&#8221; I informed.
&#8220;But I trust that I am no sucker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No green in the eye, eh?&#8221; he approved. &#8220;Anyhow,
you have a good lead if your friend in black
cottons to you.&#8221; Again he winked. &#8220;You&#8217;re not a
bad-looking young feller.&#8221; He leaned over the side
steps, and gazed ahead. &#8220;Sidney in sight. Be there
directly. We&#8217;re hitting twenty miles and better
through the greatest country on earth. The engineer
smells breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>I RISE IN FAVOR</h3>
</div>

<p>With that he went forward. So did I; but the
barricade at the end of My Lady&#8217;s seat was intact,
and I sat down in my own seat, to keep expectant
eye upon her profile&mdash;a decided relief amidst that
crude mélange of people in various stages of hasty
dressing after a night of cramped postures.</p>
<p>The brakeman&#8217;s words, although mysterious in
part, had concluded reassuringly. My Lady, he said,
would prove a valuable friend in Benton. A friend
at hand means a great deal to any young man,
stranger in a strange land.</p>
<p>The conductor came back&mdash;a new conductor;
stooped familiarly over the barricade and evidently
exchanged pleasantries with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sidney! Sidney! Twenty minutes for breakfast!&#8221;
the brakeman bawled, from the door.</p>
<p>There was the general stir. My Lady shot a glance
at me, with inviting eyes, but arose in response to the
proffered arm of the conductor, and I was late. The
aisle filled between us as he ushered her on and the
train slowed to grinding of brakes and the tremendous
clanging of a gong.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>Of Sidney there was little to see: merely a station-house
and the small Railroad Hotel, with a handful
of other buildings forming a single street&mdash;all squatting
here near a rock quarry that broke the expanse
of uninhabited brown plains. The air, however, was
wonderfully invigorating; the meal excellent, as usual;
and when I emerged from the dining-room, following
closely a black figure crowned with gold, I found her
strolling alone upon the platform.</p>
<p>Therefore I caught up with her. She faced me
with ready smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are rather slow in action, sir,&#8221; she lightly
accused. &#8220;We might have breakfasted together; but
it was the conductor again, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I plead guilty, madam,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;The trainmen
have an advantage over me, in anticipating
events. But the next meal shall be my privilege. We
stop again before reaching Benton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For dinner, yes; at Cheyenne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And after that you will be home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Home?&#8221; she queried, with a little pucker between
her brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. At Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221; She laughed shortly. &#8220;Benton is
now home. We have moved so frequently that I
have grown to call almost no place home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I judge then that you are connected, as may happen,
with a flexible business,&#8221; I hazarded. &#8220;If you
are in the army I can understand.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not an army woman; but there is money
in following the railroad, and that is our present life,&#8221;
she said frankly. &#8220;A town springs up, you know, at
each terminus, booms as long as the freight and passengers
pile up&mdash;and all of a sudden the go-ahead
business and professional men pull stakes for the
next terminus as soon as located. That has been
the custom, all the way from North Platte to Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which accounts for your acquaintance along the
line. The trainmen seem to know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trainmen and others; oh, yes. It is to be expected.
I have no objections to that. I am quite able
to take care of myself, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were interrupted. A near-drunken rowdy
(upon whom I had kept an uneasy corner of an eye)
had been careening over the platform, a whiskey bottle
protruding from the hip pocket of his sagging
jeans, a large revolver dangling at his thigh, his
slouch hat cocked rakishly upon his tousled head. His
language was extremely offensive&mdash;he had an ugly
mood on, but nobody interfered. The crowd stood
aside&mdash;the natives laughing, the tourists like myself
viewing him askance, and several Indians watching
only gravely.</p>
<p>He sighted us, and staggered in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy?&#8221; he uttered, with an oath. &#8220;Shay&mdash;hello,
stranger. Have a smile. Take two, one for
lady. Hic!&#8221; And he thrust his bottle at me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>My Lady drew back. I civilly declined the
&#8220;smile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I do not drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; He stared blearily. His tone stiffened.
&#8220;The hell you say. Too tony, eh? Too&mdash;&#8217;ic! Have
a smile, I ask you, one gent to &#8217;nother. Have a smile,
you (unmentionable) pilgrim; fer if you don&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Train&#8217;s starting, Jim,&#8221; she interposed sharply.
&#8220;If you want to get aboard you&#8217;d better hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The engine tooted, the bell was ringing, the passengers
were hurrying, incited by the conductor&#8217;s
shout: &#8220;All &#8217;board!&#8221;</p>
<p>Without another word she tripped for the car steps.
I gave the fellow one firm look as he stood stupidly
scratching his thatch as if to harrow his ideas; and
perforce left him. By the cheers he undoubtedly
made in the same direction. I was barely in time
myself. The train moved as I planted foot upon the
steps of the nearest car&mdash;the foremost of the two.
The train continued; halted again abruptly, while
cheers rang riotous; and when I crossed the passageway
between this car and ours the conductor and
brakeman were hauling the tipsy Jim into safety.</p>
<p>My Lady was ensconced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they get him?&#8221; she inquired, when I paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the scruff of the neck. The drunken fellow,
you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s from Benton. I suppose he&#8217;s been down
here on a little pasear, as they say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think he&#8217;ll annoy you&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; I made
bold to suggest, for I greatly coveted the half of her
seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not afraid of Jim. But yes, do sit down.
You can put these things back in your seat. Then we
can talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had no more than settled triumphantly, when the
brakeman ambled through, his face in a broad grin.
He also paused, to perch upon the seat end, his arm
extended friendlily along the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we got him corralled,&#8221; he proclaimed needlessly.
&#8220;That t&#8217;rantular juice nigh broke his neck for
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you take his bottle away, Jerry?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing. He&#8217;ll be peaceable directly. Soused
to the guards. Reckon he&#8217;s inclined to be a trifle ugly
when he&#8217;s on a tear, ain&#8217;t he? They&#8217;d shipped him
out of Benton on a down train. Now he&#8217;s going back
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s safe, you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sewed tight. He&#8217;ll sleep it off and be ready
for night.&#8221; The brakeman winked at her. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t fear. He&#8217;ll be on deck, right side up with
care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told this gentleman that I&#8217;m not afraid,&#8221; she
answered quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. And he knows what&#8217;s best for him,
himself.&#8221; The brakeman slapped me on the shoulder
and good-naturedly straightened. &#8220;So does this
young gentleman, I rather suspicion. I can see his
fortune&#8217;s made. You bet, if he works it right. I
told him if you cottoned to him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking too much, Jerry,&#8221; she reproved.
&#8220;The gentleman and I are only traveling acquaintances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. To Benton. Let &#8217;er roar. Cheyenne&#8217;s
the closest I can get, myself, and Cheyenne&#8217;s a
dead one&mdash;blowed up, busted worse&#8217;n a galvanized
Yank with a pocket full o&#8217; Confed wall-paper.&#8221; He
yawned. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll take forty winks. Was up all
night, and a man can stand jest so much, Injuns or
no Injuns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you expect to meet with Indians, sir, along
the route?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell, yes. Always expect to meet &#8217;em between
Kearney and Julesburg. It&#8217;s about time they were
wrecking another train. Well, so long. Be good to
each other.&#8221; With this parting piece of impertinence
he stumped out.</p>
<p>&#8220;A friendly individual, evidently,&#8221; I hazarded, to
tide her over her possible embarrassment.</p>
<p>Her laugh assured me that she was not embarrassed
at all, which proved her good sense and elevated her
even farther in my esteem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jerry&#8217;s all right. I don&#8217;t mind Jerry, except
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
that his tongue is hung in the middle. He probably
has been telling you some tall yarns?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He? No, I don&#8217;t think so. He may have tried
it, but his Western expressions are beyond me as yet.
In fact, what he was driving at on the rear platform
I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Driving at? In what way, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He referred to the green in his eye and in the
moon, as I recall; and to a mysterious &#8216;system&#8217;; and
gratuitously offered me a &#8216;steer.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face hardened remarkably, so that her chin set
as if tautened by iron bands. Those eyes glinted with
real menace.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did, did he? Along that line of talk! The
clapper-jaw! He&#8217;s altogether too free.&#8221; She surveyed
me keenly. &#8220;And naturally you couldn&#8217;t understand
such lingo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not curious enough to try, my dear madam.
He talked rather at random; likely enjoyed bantering
me. But,&#8221; I hastily placated in his behalf, &#8220;he recommended
Benton as a lively place, and you as a friend
of value in case that you honored me with your patronage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My patronage, for you?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Indeed?
To what extent? Are you going into business,
too? As one of&mdash;us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I should become a Bentonite, as I hope,&#8221; I gallantly
replied, &#8220;then of course I should look to permanent
investment of some nature. And before my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
traveling funds run out I shall be glad of light employment.
The brakeman gave me to understand
merely that by your kindly interest you might be disposed
to assist me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Her face lightened. &#8220;I dare say Jerry
means well. But when you spoke of &#8216;patronage&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;
That is a current term of certain import
along the railroad.&#8221; She leaned to me; a glow emanated
from her. &#8220;Tell me of yourself. You have red
blood? Do you ever game? For if you are not
afraid to test your luck and back it, there is money to
be made very easily at Benton, and in a genteel way.&#8221;
She smiled bewitchingly. &#8220;Or are you a Quaker, to
whom life is deadly serious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No Quaker, madam.&#8221; How could I respond
otherwise to that pair of dancing blue eyes, to that
pair of derisive lips? &#8220;As for gaming&mdash;if you mean
cards, why, I have played at piquet and romp, in a
social way, for small stakes; and my father brought
Old Sledge back from the army, to the family table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are lucky. I can see it,&#8221; she alleged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, on this journey,&#8221; I asserted.</p>
<p>She blushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well said, sir. And if you choose to make use of
your luck, in Benton, by all means&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether she would have shaped her import clearly
I did not know. There was a commotion in the forward
part of the car. That same drunken wretch
Jim had appeared; his bottle (somehow restored to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
him) in hand, his hat pushed back from his flushed
greasy forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a smile, ladies an&#8217; gents,&#8221; he was bellowing
thickly. &#8220;Hooray! Have a smile on me. Great an&#8217;
gloryus &#8217;casion&mdash;&#8217;ic! Ever&#8217;body smile. Drink to
op&#8217;nin&#8217; gloryus Pac&#8217;fic&mdash;&#8217;ic&mdash;Railway. Thash it.
Hooray!&#8221; Thus he came reeling down the aisle,
thrusting his bottle right and left, to be denied with
shrinkings or with bluff excuses.</p>
<p>It seemed inevitable that he should reach us. I
heard My Lady utter a little gasp, as she sat more
erect; and here he was, espying us readily enough
with that uncanny precision of a drunken man, his
bottle to the fore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a smile, you two. Wouldn&#8217;t smile at station;
gotto smile now. Yep. &#8217;Ic! &#8217;Ray for Benton!
All goin&#8217; to Benton. Lesh be good fellers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You go back to your seat, Jim,&#8221; she ordered
tensely. &#8220;Go back, if you know what&#8217;s good for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whash that? Who your dog last year? Shay!
You can&#8217;t come no highty-tighty over me. Who your
new friend? Shay!&#8221; He reeled and gripped the
seat, flooding me with his vile breath. &#8220;By Gawd,
I got the dead-wood on you, you&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221; and he had
loosed such a torrent of low epithets that they are
inconceivable.</p>
<p>&#8220;For that I&#8217;d kill you in any other place, Jim,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You know I&#8217;m not afraid of you. Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
get, you wolf!&#8221; Her voice snapped like a whip-lash
at the close; she had made sudden movement of hand&mdash;it
was extended and I saw almost under my nose
the smallest pistol imaginable; nickeled, of two barrels,
and not above three inches long; projecting from her
palm, the twin hammers cocked; and it was as steady
as a die.</p>
<p>Assuredly My Lady did know how to take care of
herself. Still, that was not necessary now.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; I warned. &#8220;No matter. I&#8217;ll tend to
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fellow&#8217;s face had convulsed with a snarl of
redder rage, his mouth opened as if for fresh abuse&mdash;and
half rising I landed upon it with my fist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go where you belong, you drunken whelp!&#8221;</p>
<p>I had struck and spoken at the same time, with a
rush of wrath that surprised me; and the result surprised
me more, for while I was not conscious of having
exerted much force he toppled backward clear
across the aisle, crashed down in a heap under the opposite
seat. His bottle shattered against the ceiling.
The whiskey spattered in a sickening shower over the
alarmed passengers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out! Look out!&#8221; she cried, starting
quickly. Up he scrambled, cursing, and wrenching at
his revolver. I sprang to smother him, but there was
a flurry, a chorus of shouts, men leaped between us,
the brakeman and conductor both had arrived, in a
jiffy he was being hustled forward, swearing and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
blubbering. And I sank back, breathless, a degree
ashamed, a degree rather satisfied with my action and
my barked knuckles.</p>
<p>Congratulations echoed dully.</p>
<p>&#8220;The right spirit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll l&#8217;arn him to insult a lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sartinly rattled him up, stranger. Squar&#8217; on
the twitter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake, Mister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a pilgrim you&#8217;re consider&#8217;ble of a hoss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;d drawn you&#8217;d have give him a pill, I reckon,
lady. I know yore kind. But he won&#8217;t bother you
ag&#8217;in; not he.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a terrible scene!&#8221;</p>
<p>To all this I paid scant attention. I heard her, as
she sat composedly, scarcely panting. The little pistol
had disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;The play has been made, ladies and gentlemen,&#8221;
she said. And to me: &#8220;Thank you. Yes,&#8221; she continued,
with a flash of lucent eyes and a dimpling
smile, &#8220;Jim has lost his whiskey and has a chance to
sober up. He&#8217;ll have forgotten all about this before
we reach Benton. But I thank you for your promptness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want you to shoot him,&#8221; I stammered.
&#8220;I was quite able to tend to him myself. Your pistol
is loaded?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure it is.&#8221; And she laughed gaily. Her
lips tightened, her eyes darkened. &#8220;And I&#8217;d kill him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
like a dog if he presumed farther. In this country we
women protect ourselves from insult. I always carry
my derringer, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brakeman returned with a broom, to sweep up
the chips of broken bottle. He grinned at us.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no wind in him now,&#8221; he communicated.
&#8220;Peaceful as a baby. We took his gun off him. I&#8217;ll
pass the word ahead to keep him safe, on from Cheyenne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do, Jerry,&#8221; she bade. &#8220;I&#8217;d prefer to have
no more trouble with him, for he might not come out
so easily next time. He knows that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely ought to, by golly,&#8221; the brakeman agreed
roundly. &#8220;And he ought to know you go heeled.
But that there tanglefoot went to his head. Looks
now as if he&#8217;d been kicked in the face by a mule.
Haw haw! No offense, friend. You got me plumb
buffaloed with that fivespot o&#8217; yourn.&#8221; And finishing
his job he retired with dust-pan and broom.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to do well in Benton,&#8221; she said suddenly,
to me, with a nod. &#8220;I regret this scene&mdash;I
couldn&#8217;t help it, though, of course. When Jim&#8217;s sober
he has sense, and never tries to be familiar.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was amazingly cool under the epithets that he
had applied. I admired her for that as she gazed at
me pleadingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A drunken man is not responsible for words or
actions, although he should be made so,&#8221; I consoled
her. &#8220;Possibly I should not have struck him. In the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
Far West you may be more accustomed to these episodes
than we are in the East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. There is a limit. You did right.
I thank you heartily. Still&#8221;&mdash;and she mused&mdash;&#8220;you
can&#8217;t always depend on your fists alone. You carry
no weapon, neither knife nor gun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never have needed either,&#8221; said I. &#8220;My teaching
has been that a man should be able to rely upon
his fists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better get &#8217;heeled,&#8217; as we say, when
you reach Benton. Fists are a short-range weapon.
The men generally wear a gun somewhere. It is the
custom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the women, too, if I may judge,&#8221; I smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of us. Yes,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;you&#8217;re likely
to do well, out here, if you&#8217;ll permit me to advise you
a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Under your tutelage I am sure I shall do well,&#8221;
I accepted. &#8220;I may call upon you in Benton? If you
will favor me with your address&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My address?&#8221; She searched my face in manner
startled. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have no difficulty finding me; not
in Benton. But I&#8217;ll make an appointment with you in
event&#8221;&mdash;and she smiled archly&mdash;&#8220;you are not afraid
of strange women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been taught to respect women, madam,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;And my respect is being strengthened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; I seemed to have pleased her. &#8220;You have
been carefully brought up, sir.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To fear God, respect woman, and act the man as
long as I breathe,&#8221; I asserted. &#8220;My mother is a
saint, my father a nobleman, and what I may have
learned from them is to their credit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may go excellently in the East,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;But we in the West favor the Persian
maxim&mdash;to ride, to shoot, and to tell the truth. With
those three qualities even a tenderfoot can establish
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether I can ride and shoot sufficient for the
purpose, time will show,&#8221; I retorted. &#8220;At least,&#8221; and
I endeavored to speak with proper emphasis, &#8220;you
hear the truth when I say that I anticipate much pleasure
as well as renewed health, in Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were we by ourselves we would seal the future
in another &#8217;smile&#8217; together,&#8221; she slyly promised.
&#8220;Unless that might shock you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ready to fall in with the customs of the
country,&#8221; I assured. &#8220;I certainly am not averse to
smiles, when fittingly proffered.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we exchanged fancies while the train rolled over
a track remarkable for its smoothness and leading
ever onward across the vast, empty plains bare save
for the low shrubs called sage-brush, and rising here
and there into long swells and abrupt sandstone pinnacles.</p>
<p>We stopped near noon at the town of Cheyenne, in
Wyoming Territory. Cheyenne, once boasting the
title (I was told) &#8220;The Magic City of the Plains,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
was located upon a dreary flatness, although from it
one might see, far southwest, the actual Rocky Mountains
in Colorado Territory, looking, at this distance
of one hundred miles, like low dark clouds. The up
grade in the west promised that we should soon cross
over their northern flanks, of the Black Hills.</p>
<p>Last winter, Cheyenne, I was given to understand,
had ten thousand inhabitants; but the majority had
followed the railroad west, so that now there remained
only some fifteen hundred. After dinner we,
too, went west.</p>
<p>We overcame the Black Hills Mountains about two
o&#8217;clock, having climbed to the top with considerable
puffing of the engine but otherwise almost imperceptibly
to the passengers. When we were halted, upon
the crown, at Sherman Station, to permit us to alight
and see for ourselves, I scarcely might believe that we
were more than eight thousand feet in air. There was
nothing to indicate, except some little difficulty of
breath; not so much as I had feared when in Cheyenne,
whose six thousand feet gave me a slightly
giddy sensation.</p>
<p>My Lady moved freely, being accustomed to the
rarity; and she assured me that although Benton was
seven thousand feet I would soon grow wonted to the
atmosphere. The habitués of this country made light
of the spot; the strangers on tour picked flowers and
gathered rocks as mementoes of the &#8220;Crest of the
Continent&#8221;&mdash;which was not a crest but rather a level
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
plateau, wind-swept and chilly while sunny. Then
from this Sherman Summit of the Black Hills of
Wyoming the train swept down by its own momentum
from gravity, for the farther side.</p>
<p>The fellow Jim had not emerged, as yet, much to
my relief. The scenery was increasing in grandeur
and interest, and the play of my charming companion
would have transformed the most prosaic of journeys
into a trip through Paradise.</p>
<p>I hardly noted the town named Laramie City, at the
western base of the Black Hills; and was indeed annoyed
by the vendors hawking what they termed
&#8220;mountain gems&#8221; through the train. Laramie, according
to My Lady, also once had been, as she styled
it, &#8220;a live town,&#8221; but had deceased in favor of Benton.
From Laramie we whirled northwest, through a
broad valley enlivened by countless antelope scouring
over the grasses; thence we issued into a wilder,
rougher country, skirting more mountains very
gloomy in aspect.</p>
<p>However, of the panorama outside I took but casual
glances; the phenomenon of blue and gold so close
at hand was all engrossing, and my heart beat high
with youth and romance. Our passage was astonishingly
short, but the sun was near to setting beyond
distant peaks when by the landmarks that she knew
we were approaching Benton at last.</p>
<p>We crossed a river&mdash;the Platte, again, even away
in here; briefly paused at a military post, and entered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
upon a stretch of sun-baked, reddish-white, dusty desert
utterly devoid of vegetation.</p>
<p>There was a significant bustle in the car, among
the travel-worn occupants. The air was choking with
the dust swirled through every crevice by the stir of
the wheels&mdash;already mobile as it was from the efforts
of the teams that we passed, of six and eight
horses tugging heavy wagons. Plainly we were
within striking distance of some focus of human
energies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Benton! Benton in five minutes. End o&#8217; track,&#8221;
the brakeman shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;My valise, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>I brought it. The conductor, who like the other
officials knew My Lady, pushed through to us and
laid hand upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you out,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Come ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon. That shall be my privilege,&#8221; I interposed.
But she quickly denied.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, please. The conductor is an old friend. I
shall need no other help&mdash;I&#8217;m perfectly at home.
You can look out for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I shall see you again&mdash;and where? I don&#8217;t
know your address; fact is, I&#8217;m even ignorant of your
name,&#8221; I pleaded desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;How stupid of me.&#8221; And she spoke fast and
low, over her shoulder. &#8220;To-night, then, at the Big
Tent. Remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>I pressed after.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Tent! Shall I inquire there? And for
whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not fail to see me. Everybody knows the
Big Tent, everybody goes there. So au revoir.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was swallowed in the wake of the conductor,
and I fain must gather my own belongings before following.
The Big Tent, she said? I had not misunderstood;
and I puzzled over the address, which impinged
as rather bizarre, whether in West or East.</p>
<p>We stopped with a jerk, amidst a babel of cries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Benton! All out!&#8221; Out we stumbled. Here I
was, at rainbow&#8217;s end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>I MEET FRIENDS</h3>
</div>

<p>What shall I say of a young man like myself, fresh
from the green East of New York and the Hudson
River, landed expectant as just aroused from a dream
of rare beauty, at this Benton City, Wyoming Territory?
The dust, as fine as powder and as white, but
shot through with the crimson of sunset, hung like a
fog, amidst which swelled a deafening clamor from
figures rushing hither and thither about the platform
like half-world shades. A score of voices dinned into
my ears as two score hands grabbed at my valise and
shoved me and dragged me.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Desert Hotel. Best in the West. This way,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Buffalo Hump Corral! The Buffalo Hump!
Free drinks at the Buffalo Hump.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vamos, all o&#8217; you. Leave the gent to me. I&#8217;ve
had him before. Mike&#8217;s Place for you, eh? Come
along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Widow&#8217;s Café! That&#8217;s yore grub pile, gent.
All you can eat for two bits.&#8221;</p>
<p>A deep voice boomed, stunning me.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Queen, the Queen! Bath for every room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
Individual towels. The Queen, the Queen, she&#8217;s
clean, she&#8217;s clean.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a magnificent bass, full toned as an organ,
issuing, likewise as out of a reed, from a swart dwarf
scarcely higher than my waist. The word &#8220;bath,&#8221;
with the promise of &#8220;individual towels,&#8221; won me
over. Something must be done, anyway, to get rid
of these importunate runners. Thereupon I acquiesced,
&#8220;All right, my man. The Queen,&#8221; and surrendering
my bag to his hairy paw I trudged by his
guidance. The solicitations instantly ceased as if in
agreement with some code.</p>
<p>We left the station platform and went ploughing
up a street over shoetops with the impalpable dust
and denoted by tents and white-coated shacks sparsely
bordering. The air was breezeless and suffocatingly
loaded with that dust not yet deposited. The noises
as from a great city swelled strident: shouts, hammerings,
laughter, rumble of vehicles, cracking of
lashes, barkings of dogs innumerable&mdash;betokening a
thriving mart of industry. But although pedestrians
streamed to and fro, the men in motley of complexions
and costumes, the women, some of them fashionably
dressed, with skirts eddying furiously; and
wagons rolled, horses cantered, and from right and
left merchants and hawksters seemed to be calling
their wares, of city itself I could see only the veriest
husk.</p>
<p>The majority of the buildings were mere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
canvas-faced up for a few feet, perhaps, with sheet iron or
flimsy boards; interspersed there were a few wooden
structures, rough and unpainted; and whereas several
of the housings were large, none was more than two
stories&mdash;and when now and again I thought that I
had glimpsed a substantial stone front a closer inspection
told me that the stones were imitation, forming a
veneer of the sheet iron or of stenciled pine. Indeed,
not a few of the upper stories, viewed from an unfavorable
angle, proved to be only thin parapets upstanding
for a pretense of well-being. Behind them,
nothing at all!</p>
<p>In the confusion of that which I took to be the main
street because of the stores and piles of goods and the
medley of signs, what with the hubbub from the many
barkers for saloons and gambling games, the constant
dodging among the pedestrians, vehicles and horses
and dogs, in a thoroughfare that was innocent of
sidewalk, I really had scant opportunity to gaze; certainly
no opportunity as yet to get my bearings. My
squat guide shuttled aside; a group of loafers gave us
passage, with sundry stares at me and quips for him;
and I was ushered into a widely-open tent-building
whose canvas sign depending above a narrow veranda
declared: &#8220;The Queen Hotel. Beds $3. Meals $1
each.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now as whitely powdered as any of the natives I
stumbled across a single large room bordered at one
side by a bar and a number of small tables (all well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
patronized), and was brought up at the counter, under
the alert eyes of a clerk coatless, silk-shirted, diamond-scarfed,
pomaded and slick-haired, waiting with register
turned and pen extended.</p>
<p>My gnome heavily dropped my bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gent for you,&#8221; he presented.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish a room and bath,&#8221; I said, as I signed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bath is occupied. I&#8217;ll put you down, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
and he glanced at the signature. &#8220;Four dollars and
four bits, please. Show the gentleman to Number
Six, Shorty. That drummer&#8217;s gone, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bath is occupied?&#8221; I expostulated. &#8220;How
so? I wish a private bath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Private? Yes, sir. All you&#8217;ve got to do is to
close the door while you&#8217;re in. Nobody&#8217;ll disturb you.
But there are parties ahead of you. First come, first
served.&#8221;</p>
<p>I persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your runner&mdash;this gentleman, if I am not mistaken
(and I indicated the gnome, who grinned from
dusty face), distinctly said &#8216;A bath for every
room.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bystanders had pushed nearer, to examine the register
and then me. They laughed&mdash;nudged one another.
Evidently I had a trace of green in my
eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right, sir,&#8221; the clerk assented. &#8220;So there
is. A bath for every room and the best bath in town.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
Entirely private; fresh towel supplied. Only one dollar
and four bits. That, with lodging, makes four
dollars and a half. If you please, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In advance?&#8221; I remonstrated&mdash;the bath charge
alone being monstrous.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you&#8217;re from the East. Yes, sir; we have
to charge transients in advance. That is the rule, sir.
You stay in Benton City for some time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am undetermined.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, sir. Your own affair. Yes, sir. But
we shall hope to make Benton pleasant for you. The
greatest city in the West. Anything you want for
pleasure or business you&#8217;ll find right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest city in the West&mdash;pleasure or business!&#8221;
A bitter wave of homesickness welled into
my throat as, conscious of the enveloping dust, the
utter shams, the tawdriness, the alien unsympathetic
onlookers, the suave but incisive manner of the clerk,
the sense of having been &#8220;done&#8221; and through my own
fault, I peeled a greenback from the folded packet in
my purse and handed it over. Rather foolishly I intended
that this display of funds should rebuke the
finicky clerk; but he accepted without comment and
sought for the change from the twenty.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how is old New York, suh?&#8221;</p>
<p>A hearty, florid, heavy-faced man, with singularly
protruding fishy eyes and a tobacco-stained yellowish
goatee underneath a loosely dropping lower lip, had
stepped forward, his pudgy hand hospitably outstretched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
to me: a man in wide-brimmed dusty black
hat, frayed and dusty but, in spots, shiny, black broadcloth
frock coat spattered down the lapels, exceedingly
soiled collar and shirt front and greasy flowing
tie, and trousers tucked into cowhide boots.</p>
<p>I grasped the hand wonderingly. It enclosed mine
with a soft pulpy squeeze; and lingered.</p>
<p>&#8220;As usual, when I last saw it, sir,&#8221; I responded.
&#8220;But I am from Albany.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Albany, the capital, a city to be
proud of, suh. I welcome you, suh, to our new West,
as a fellow-citizen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are from Albany?&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bohn and raised right near there; been there
many a time. Yes, suh. From the grand old Empire
State, like yourself, suh, and without apologies.
Whenever I meet with a New York State man I cotton
to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I your name, sir?&#8221; I inquired. &#8220;You
know of my family, perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Jacob B. Sunderson, suh, at your service.
Your family name is familiar to me, suh. I hark
back to it and to the grand old State with pleasure.
Doubtless I have seen you befoh, sur. Doubtless in the
City&mdash;at Johnny Chamberlain&#8217;s? Yes?&#8221; His fishy
eyes beamed upon me, and his breath smelled strongly
of liquor. &#8220;Or the Astor? I shall remember. Meanwhile,
suh, permit me to do the honors. First, will
you have a drink? This way, suh. I am partial to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
a brand particularly to be recommended for clearing
this damnable dust from one&#8217;s throat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir, but I prefer to tidy my person,
first,&#8221; I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Number Six for the gentleman,&#8221; announced the
clerk, returning to me my change from the bill. I
stuffed it into my pocket&mdash;the Colonel&#8217;s singular eyes
followed it with uncomfortable interest. The gnome
picked up my bag, but was interrupted by my new
friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;The privilege of showing the gentleman to his
quarters and putting him at home shall be mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Colonel,&#8221; the clerk carelessly consented.
&#8220;Number Six.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And my trunk. I have a trunk at the depot,&#8221; I
informed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy will tend to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gave the gnome my check.</p>
<p>&#8220;And my bath?&#8221; I pursued.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be notified, sir. There are only five
ahead of you, and one gentleman now in. Your turn
will come in about two hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This way, suh. Kindly follow me,&#8221; bade the
Colonel. As he strode before, slightly listed by the
weight of the bag in his left hand, I remarked a peculiar
bulge elevating the portly contour of his right
coat-skirt.</p>
<p>We ascended a flight of rude stairs which quivered
to our tread, proceeded down a canvas-lined corridor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
set at regular intervals on either hand with numbered
deal doors, some open to reveal disorderly interiors;
and with &#8220;Here you are, suh,&#8221; I was importantly
bowed into Number Six.</p>
<p>We were not to be alone. There were three double
beds: one well rumpled as if just vacated; one (the
middle) tenanted by a frowsy headed, whiskered man
asleep in shirt-sleeves and revolver and boots; the
third, at the other end, recently made up by having its
blanket covering hastily thrown against a distinctly
dirty pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your bed yonduh, suh, I reckon,&#8221; prompted the
Colonel (whose accents did not smack of New York
at all), depositing my bag with a grunt of relief.
&#8220;Now, suh, as you say, you desire to freshen the
outer man after your journey. With your permission
I will await your pleasure, suh; and your toilet
being completed we will freshen the inner man also
with a glass or two of rare good likker.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gazed about, sickened. Item, three beds; item,
one kitchen chair; item, one unpainted board washstand,
supporting a tin basin, a cake of soap, a tin
ewer, with a dingy towel hanging from a nail under
a cracked mirror and over a tin slop-bucket; item,
three spittoons, one beside each bed; item, a row of
nails in a wooden strip, plainly for wardrobe purposes;
item, one window, with broken pane.</p>
<p>The board floor was bare and creaky, the partition
walls were of once-white, stained muslin through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
which sifted unrebuked a mixture of sounds not thoroughly
agreeable.</p>
<p>The Colonel had seated himself upon a bed; the
bulge underneath his skirts jutted more pronouncedly,
and had the outlines of a revolver butt.</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely I can get a room to myself,&#8221; I stammered.
&#8220;The clerk mistakes me. This won&#8217;t do at
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are having the best in the house, suh,&#8221; asserted
the Colonel, with expansive wave of his thick
hand. He spat accurately into the convenient spittoon.
&#8220;It is a front room, suh. Number Six is
known as very choice, and I congratulate you, suh. I
myself will see to it that you shall have your bed to
yourself, if you entertain objections to doubling up.
We are, suh, a trifle crowded in Benton City, just at
present, owing to the unprecedented influx of new
citizens. You must remember, suh, that we are less
than one month old, and we are accommodating from
three to five thousand people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the best hotel?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so reckoned, suh. There are other hostelries,
and I do not desire, suh, to draw invidious comparisons,
their proprietors being friends of mine.
But I will go so far as to say that the Queen caters
only to the élite, suh, and its patronage is gilt
edge.&#8221;</p>
<p>I stepped to the window, the lower sash of which
was up, and gazed out&mdash;down into that dust-fogged,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
noisy, turbulent main street, of floury human beings
and grime-smeared beasts almost within touch, boiling
about through the narrow lane between the placarded
makeshift structures. I lifted my smarting
eyes, and across the hot sheet-iron roofs I saw the
country south&mdash;a white-blotched reddish desert
stretching on, desolate, lifeless under the sunset, to a
range of stark hills black against the glow.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no private rooms, then?&#8221; I asked,
choking with a gulp of despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are perfectly private right here, suh,&#8221; assured
the Colonel. &#8220;You may strip to the hide or
you may sleep with your boots on, and no questions
asked. Gener&#8217;ly speaking, gentlemen prefer to retain
a layer of artificial covering&mdash;but you ain&#8217;t troubled
much with the bugs, are you, Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>He leveled this query at the frowsy, whiskered
man, who had awakened and was blinking contentedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too alkalied, I reckon,&#8221; Bill responded.
&#8220;Varmints will leave me any time when there&#8217;s fresh
bait handy. That&#8217;s why I likes to double up. That
there Saint Louee drummer carried off most of &#8217;em
from this gent&#8217;s bed, so he&#8217;s safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are again to be congratulated, suh,&#8221; addressed
the Colonel, to me. &#8220;Allow me to interdeuce
you. Shake hands with my friend Mr. Bill Brady.
Bill, I present to you a fellow-citizen of mine from
grand old New York State.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>The frowsy man struggled up, shifted his revolver
so as not to sit on it, and extended his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Proud to make yore acquaintance, sir. Any
friend of the Colonel&#8217;s is a friend o&#8217; mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will likker up directly,&#8221; the Colonel informed.
&#8220;But fust the gentleman desires to attend to his person.
Mr. Brady, suh,&#8221; he continued, for my benefit,
&#8220;is one of our leading citizens, being proprietor of&mdash;what
is it now, Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall,&#8221; said Mr. Brady, &#8220;I&#8217;ve pulled out o&#8217; the
Last Chance and I&#8217;m on spec&#8217;. The Last Chance got
a leetle too much on the brace for healthy play; and
when that son of a gun of a miner from South Pass
City shot it up, I quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; conceded the Colonel. &#8220;Mr. Brady,&#8221;
he explained, &#8220;has been one of our most distinguished
bankers, but he has retired from that industry and is
considering other investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bath-room? Where is it, gentlemen?&#8221; I
ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will step outside the door, suh, you can
hear the splashing down the hall. It is the custom,
however, foh gentlemen at tub to keep the bath-room
door closed, in case of ladies promenading. You will
have time foh your preliminary toilet and foh a little
refreshment and a pasear in town. I judge, with five
ahead of you and one in, the clerk was mighty near
right when he said about two hours. That allows
twenty minutes to each gentleman, which is the limit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
A gentleman who requires more than twenty minutes
to insure his respectability, suh, is too dirty foh such
accommodations. He should resort to the river.
Ain&#8217;t that so, Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly correct, Colonel. I kin take an all-over,
myself, in fifteen, whenever it&#8217;s healthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a dollar and a half for a twenty minutes&#8217; bath
in a public tub is rather steep, seems to me,&#8221; said I,
as I removed my coat and opened my bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so, suh, if I may question your judgment,&#8221;
the Colonel reproved. &#8220;The tub, suh, is private to
the person in it. He is never intruded upon unless he
hawgs his time or the water disagrees with him. The
water, suh, is hauled from the river by a toilsome
journey of three miles. You understand, suh, that
this great and growing city is founded upon the sheer
face of the Red Desert, where the railroad stopped&mdash;the
river being occupied by a Government reservation
named Fort Steele. The Government&mdash;the United
States Government, suh&mdash;having corralled the river
where the railroad crosses, until we procure a nearer
supply by artesian wells or by laying a pipe line we
are public spirited enough to haul our water bodily,
for ablution purposes, at ten dollars the barrel, or ten
cents, one dime, the bucket. A bath, suh, uses up
consider&#8217;ble water, even if at a slight reduction you
are privileged to double up with another gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shuddered at the thought of thus &#8220;doubling up.&#8221;
God, how my stomach sank and my gorge rose as I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
rummaged through that bag, and with my toilet articles
in hand faced the washstand!</p>
<p>They two intently watched my operations; the
Colonel craned to peer into my valise&mdash;and presently
I might interpret his curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prime old bourbon served at the fust-class
New York bars still maintains its reputation, I dare
hope, suh?&#8221; he interrogated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot say, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; I replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, suh,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Doubtless you are partial
to your own stock. That bottle which I see doesn&#8217;t
happen to be a sample of your favorite preservative?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That?&#8221; I retorted. &#8220;It is toilet water. I am
sorry to say I have no liquor with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The deficiency will soon be forgotten, suh,&#8221; the
Colonel bravely consoled. &#8220;Bill, we shall have to
personally conduct him and provide him with the
proper entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your special line o&#8217; business, if you don&#8217;t
mind my axin&#8217;?&#8221; Bill invited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am out here for my health, at present,&#8221; said I,
vainly hunting a clean spot on the towel. &#8220;I have
been advised by my physician to seek a place in the
Far West that is high and dry. Benton&#8221;&mdash;and I
laughed miserably, &#8220;certainly is dry.&#8221; For now I
began to appreciate the frankly affirmative responses
to my previous confessions. &#8220;And high, judging by
the rates.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Healthily dry, suh, in the matter of water,&#8221; the
Colonel approved. &#8220;We are not cursed by the humidity
of New York State, grand old State that she
is. Foh those who require water, there is the Platte
only three miles distant. The nearer proximity of
water we consider a detriment to the robustness of a
community. Our rainy weather is toler&#8217;bly infrequent.
The last spell we had&mdash;lemme see. There
was a brief shower, scurcely enough to sanction a
parasol by a lady, last May, warn&#8217;t it, Bill? When
we was camped at Rawlins&#8217; Springs, shooting antelope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some&#8217;ers about that time. But didn&#8217;t last long&mdash;not
more&#8217;n two minutes,&#8221; Bill responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;As foh fluids demanded by the human system, we
are abundantly blessed, suh. There is scurcely any
popular brand that you can&#8217;t get in Benton, and I hold
that we have the most skillful mixtologists in history.
There are some who are artists; artists, suh. But
mainly we prefer our likker straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re high, too,&#8221; Bill put in. &#8220;Well over seven
thousand feet, &#8217;cordin&#8217; to them railroad engineers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, suh, you are a mile and more nearer Heaven
here in Benton than you were when beside the noble
Hudson,&#8221; supplemented the Colonel. &#8220;And the prices
of living are reasonable; foh money, suh, is cheap and
ready to hand. No drink is less than two bits, and a
man won&#8217;t tote a match across a street foh less than a
drink. Money grows, suh, foh the picking. Our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
merchants are clearing thirty thousand dollars a
month, and the professional gentleman who tries to
limit his game is considered a low-down tin-horn.
Yes, suh. This is the greatest terminal of the greatest
railroad in the known world. It has Omaha, No&#8217;th
Platte, Cheyenne beat to a frazzle. You cannot fail
to prosper.&#8221; They had been critically watching me
wash and rearrange my clothing. &#8220;You are not
heeled, suh, I see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heeled?&#8221; I repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Equipped with a shooting-iron, suh. Or do you
intend to remedy that deficiency also?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not been in the habit of carrying arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Most everybody packs a gun or a bowie,&#8221; Bill
remarked. &#8220;Gents and ladies both. But there&#8217;s no
law ag&#8217;in not.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had finished my meager toilet, and was glad, for
the espionage had been annoying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I am at your service during a short period,
gentlemen,&#8221; I announced. &#8220;Later I have an engagement,
and shall ask to be excused.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel arose with alacrity. Bill stood, and
seized his hat hanging at the head of the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little liquid refreshment is in order fust, I
reckon,&#8221; quoth the Colonel. &#8220;I claim the privilege,
of course. And after that&mdash;you have sporting blood,
suh? You will desire to take a turn or two foh the
honor of the Empire State?&#8221;</p>
<p>The inference was not quite clear. To develop it I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
replied guardedly, albeit unwilling to pose as a milksop.</p>
<p>&#8220;I assuredly am not averse to any legitimate
amusement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; Bill commended. &#8220;Nobody is, who
has red in him; and a fellow kin see you&#8217;ve cut yore
eye-teeth. What might you prefer, in line of a pass-the-time,
on spec&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is there, if you please?&#8221; I encouraged.</p>
<p>He and the Colonel gravely contemplated each
other. Bill scratched his head, and slowly closed one
eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good open game of stud at the North
Star,&#8221; he proffered. &#8220;I kin get the gentleman a seat.
No limit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe our friend&#8217;s luck don&#8217;t run to stud,&#8221; hazarded
the Colonel. &#8220;Stud exacts the powers of concentration,
like faro.&#8221; And he also closed one eye.
&#8220;It&#8217;s rather early in the evening foh close quarters.
Are you particularly partial to the tiger or the
cases, suh?&#8221; he queried of me. &#8220;Or would you be
able to secure transient happiness in short games, foh
a starter, while we move along, like a bee from flower
to flower, gathering his honey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are referring to card gambling, sir,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;you have chosen a poor companion. But I
do not intend to be a spoil sport, and I shall be glad
to have you show me whatever you think worth while
in the city, so far as I have the leisure.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s it, suh.&#8221; The Colonel appeared
delighted. &#8220;Let us libate to the gods of chance, gentlemen;
and then take a stroll.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My bag will be safe here?&#8221; I prompted, as we
were about to file out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely, suh. Personal property is respected
in Benton. We&#8217;d hang the man who moved that bag
of yours the fraction of one inch.&#8221;</p>
<p>This at least was comforting. As much could not
be said of New York City. The Colonel led down
the echoing hall and the shaking stairs, into the lobby,
peopled as before by men in all modes of attire and
clustered mainly at the bar. He led directly to the
bar itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three, Ed. Name your likker, gentlemen. A
little Double X foh me, Ed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old rye,&#8221; Bill briefly ordered.</p>
<p>The bartender set out bottle and whiskey glasses,
and looked upon me. I felt that the bystanders were
waiting. My garb proclaimed the &#8220;pilgrim,&#8221; but I
was resolved to be my own master, and for liquor I
had no taste.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lemonade, if you have it,&#8221; I faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; The bartender cracked not a smile,
but a universal sigh, broken by a few sniggers, voiced
the appraisal of the audience. Some of the loafers
eyed me amusedly, some turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely, suh, you will temper that with a dash of
fortifiah,&#8221; the Colonel protested. &#8220;A pony of brandy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
Ed&mdash;or just a dash to cut the water in it. To me,
suh, the water in this country is vile&mdash;inimical to the
human stomick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said I, &#8220;but I prefer plain lemonade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The gent wants his pizen straight, same as the
rest of you,&#8221; calmly remarked the bartender.</p>
<p>My lemonade being prepared, the Colonel and Bill
tossed off full glasses of whiskey, acknowledged with
throaty &#8220;A-ah!&#8221; and smack of lips; and I hastily
quaffed my lemonade. From the dollar which the
Colonel grandly flung upon the bar he received no
change&mdash;by which I might figure that whereas whiskey
was twenty-five cents the glass, lemonade was
fifty cents.</p>
<p>We issued into the street and were at once engulfed
by a ferment of sights and sounds extraordinary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>ON GRAND TOUR</h3>
</div>

<p>The sun had set and all the golden twilight was
hazy with the dust suspended in swirl and strata over
the ugly roofs. In the canvas-faced main street the
throng and noise had increased rather than diminished
at the approach of dusk. Although clatter of
dishes mingled with the cadence, the people acted as if
they had no thought of eating; and while aware of
certain pangs myself, I felt a diffidence in proposing
supper as yet.</p>
<p>My two companions hesitated a moment, spying up
and down, which gave me opportunity to view the
scene anew. Surely such an hotch-potch never before
populated an American town: Men flannel
shirted, high booted, shaggy haired and bearded,
stumping along weighted with excess of belts and formidable
revolvers balanced, not infrequently, by
sheathed butcher-knives&mdash;men whom I took to be
teamsters, miners, railroad graders, and the like;
other men white skinned, clean shaven except perhaps
for moustaches and goatees, in white silk shirts or
ruffled bosoms, broadcloth trousers and trim footgear,
unarmed, to all appearance, but evidently respected;
men of Eastern garb like myself&mdash;tourists, maybe,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
or merchants; a squad of surveyors in picturesque
neckerchiefs, and revolver girted; trainmen, grimy
engineers and firemen; clerks, as I opined, dapper and
bustling, clad in the latest fashion, with diamonds in
flashy ties and heavy gold watch chains across their
fancy waistcoats; soldiers; men whom I took to be
Mexicans, by their velvet jackets, slashed pantaloons
and filagreed hats; darkly weathered, leathery faced,
long-haired personages, no doubt scouts and trappers,
in fringed buckskins and beaded moccasins; blanket
wrapped Indians; and women.</p>
<p>Of the women a number were unmistakable as to
vocation, being lavishly painted, strident, and bold,
and significantly dressed. I saw several in amazing
costumes of tightly fitting black like ballet girls, low
necked, short skirted, around the smooth waists snake-skin
belts supporting handsome little pistols and dainty
poignards. Contrasted there were women of other
class and, I did not doubt, of better repute; some in
gowns and bonnets that would do them credit anywhere
in New York, and some, of course, more commonly
attired in calico and gingham as proper to the
humbler station of laundresses, cooks, and so forth.</p>
<p>The uproar was a jargon of shouts, hails, music,
hammering, barking, scuff of feet, trample of horses
and oxen, rumble of creaking wagons and Concord
stages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, suh,&#8221; spoke the Colonel, pulling his hat
over his eyes, &#8220;shall we stroll a piece?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Might better,&#8221; assented Bill. &#8220;The gentleman
may find something of interest right in the open.
How are you on the goose, sir?&#8221; he demanded of me.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goose?&#8221; I uttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Keno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a stranger to the goose,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>He grunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives a quick turn for a small stake. So do the
three-card and rondo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of passageway there was not much choice between
the middle of the street and the borders.
Seemed to me as we weaved along through groups of
idlers and among busily stepping people that every
other shop was a saloon, with door widely open and
bar and gambling tables well attended. The odor of
liquor saturated the acrid dust. Yet the genuine
shops, even of the rudest construction, were piled
from the front to the rear with commodities of all
kinds, and goods were yet heaped upon the ground in
front and behind as if the merchants had no time for
unpacking. The incessant hammering, I ascertained,
came from amateur carpenters, including mere boys,
here and there engaged as if life depended upon their
efforts, in erecting more buildings from knocked-down
sections like cardboard puzzles and from lumber
already cut and numbered.</p>
<p>My guides nodded right and left with &#8220;Hello,
Frank,&#8221; &#8220;How are you, Dan?&#8221; &#8220;Evening, Charley,&#8221;
and so on. Occasionally the Colonel swept off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
his hat, with elaborate deference, to a woman, but I
looked in vain for My Lady in Black. I did not see
her&mdash;nor did I see her peer, despite the fact that now
and then I observed a face and figure of apparent attractiveness.</p>
<p>Above the staccato of conversation and exclamation
there arose the appeals of the barkers for the
gambling resorts.</p>
<p>&#8220;This way. Shall we see what he&#8217;s got?&#8221; the
Colonel invited. Forthwith veering aside he crossed
the street in obedience to a summons of whoops and
shouts that set the very dust to vibrating.</p>
<p>A crowd had gathered before a youth&mdash;a perspiring,
red-faced youth with a billy-cock hat shoved back
upon his bullet head&mdash;a youth in galluses and soiled
shirt and belled pantaloons, who, standing upon a
box for elevation, was exhorting at the top of his
lungs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoo-oop! This way, this way! Everybody
this way! Come on, you rondo-coolo sports! Give
us a bet! A bet! Rondo coolo-oh! Rondo coolo-oh!
Here&#8217;s your easy money! Down with your
soap! Let her roll! Rondo coolo-oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great game, suh,&#8221; the Colonel flung back
over his shoulder.</p>
<p>We pushed forward, to the front. The center for
the crowd was a table not unlike a small billiard table
or, saving the absence of pins, a tivoli table such as
enjoyed by children. But across one end there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
several holes, into which balls, ten or a dozen, resembling
miniature billiard balls, might roll.</p>
<p>The balls had been banked, in customary pyramid
shape for a break as in pool, at the opposite end; and
just as we arrived they had been propelled all forward,
scattering, by a short cue rapidly swept across
their base.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rondo coolo, suh,&#8221; the Colonel was explaining,
&#8220;as you see, is an improvement on the old rondo, foh
red-blooded people. You may place your bets in various
ways, on the general run, or the odd or the even;
and as the bank relies, suh, only on percentage, the
popular game is strictly square. There is no chance
foh a brace in rondo coolo. Shall we take a turn, foh
luck?&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd was craning and eyeing the gyrating
balls expectantly. A part of the balls entered the
pockets; the remainder came to rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rondo,&#8221; announced the man with the short cue,
amidst excited ejaculations from winners and losers.
And according to a system which I failed to grasp,
except that it comprised the number of balls pocketed,
he deftly distributed from one collection of checks
and coins to another, quickly absorbed by greedy
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;She rolls again. Make your bets, ladies and
gents,&#8221; he intoned. &#8220;It&#8217;s rondo coolo&mdash;simple rondo
coolo.&#8221; And he reassembled the balls.</p>
<p>&#8220;I prefer not to play, sir,&#8221; I responded to the heavily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
breathing Colonel. &#8220;I am new here and I cannot
afford to lose until I am better established.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never yet seen a man who couldn&#8217;t afford to win,
though,&#8221; Bill growled. &#8220;Easy pickin&#8217;, too. But
come on, then. We&#8217;ll give you a straight steer
some&#8217;rs else.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we left the crowd&mdash;containing indeed women as
well as men&mdash;to their insensate fervor over a childish
game under the stimulation of the raucous, sweating
barker. Of gambling devices, in the open of the
street, there was no end. My conductors appeared to
have the passion, for our course led from one method
of hazard to another&mdash;roulette, chuck-a-luck where
the patrons cast dice for prizes of money and valuables
arrayed upon numbered squares of an oilcloth
covered board, keno where numbered balls were decanted
one at a time from a bottle-shaped leather receptacle
called, I learned, the &#8220;goose,&#8221; and the players
kept tab by filling in little cards as in domestic lotto;
and finally we stopped at the simplest apparatus of
all.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spiel game for me, gentlemen,&#8221; said the
Colonel. &#8220;Here it is. Yes, suh, there&#8217;s nothing like
monte, where any man is privileged to match his eyes
against fingers. Nobody but a blind man can lose at
monte, by George!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this spieler&#8217;s on the level,&#8221; Bill pronounced,
sotto voce. &#8220;I vote we hook him for a gudgeon, and
get the price of a meal. Our friend will join us in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
the turn. He can see for himself that he can&#8217;t lose.
He&#8217;s got sharp eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bystanders here were stationed before a man
sitting at a low tripod table; and all that he had was
the small table&mdash;a plain cheap table with folding legs&mdash;and
three playing cards. Business was a trifle
slack. I thought that his voice crisped aggressively
as we elbowed through, while he sat idly skimming the
three cards over the table, with a flick of his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two jacks, and the ace, gentlemen. There they
are. I have faced them up. Now I gather them
slowly&mdash;you can&#8217;t miss them. Observe closely. The
jack on top, between thumb and forefinger. The ace
next&mdash;ace in the middle. The other jack bottommost.&#8221;
He turned his hand, with the three cards in
a tier, so that all might see. &#8220;The ace is the winning
card. You are to locate the ace. Observe closely
again. It&#8217;s my hand against your eyes. I am going
to throw. Who will spot the ace? Watch, everybody.
Ready! Go!&#8221; The backs of the cards were
up. With a swift movement he released the three,
spreading them in a neat row, face down, upon the
table. He carelessly shifted them hither and thither&mdash;and
his fingers were marvelously nimble, lightly
touching. &#8220;Twenty dollars against your twenty that
you can&#8217;t pick out the ace, first try. I&#8217;ll let the cards
lie. I shan&#8217;t disturb them. There they are. If
you&#8217;ve watched the ace fall, you win. If you haven&#8217;t,
you lose unless you guess right.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just do that trick again, will you, for the benefit
of my friend here?&#8221; bade the Colonel.</p>
<p>The &#8220;spieler&#8221;&mdash;a thin-lipped, cadaverous individual,
his soft hat cavalierly aslant, his black hair
combed flatly in a curve down upon his damp forehead,
a pair of sloe eyes, and a flannel shirt open upon
his bony chest&mdash;glanced alert. He smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, sir. I&#8217;m agreeable. Yes, sir. But as
they lie, will you make a guess? No? Or you, sir?&#8221;
And he addressed Bill. &#8220;No? Then you, sir?&#8221;
He appealed to me. &#8220;No? But I&#8217;m a mind-reader.
I can tell by your eyes. They&#8217;re upon the right-end
card. Aha! Correct.&#8221; He had turned up the card
and shown the ace. &#8220;You should have bet. You
would have beaten me, sir. You&#8217;ve got the eyes. I
think you&#8217;ve seen this game before. No? Ah, but
you have, or else you&#8217;re born lucky. Now I&#8217;ll try
again. For the benefit of these three gentlemen I will
try again. Kindly reserve your bets, friends all, and
you shall have your chance. This game never stops.
I am always after revenge. Watch the ace. I pick
up the cards. Ace first&mdash;blessed ace; <i>and</i> the jacks.
Watch close. There you are.&#8221; He briefly exposed
the faces of the cards. &#8220;Keep your eyes upon the
ace. Ready&mdash;go!&#8221;</p>
<p>He spread the cards. As he had released he had
tilted them slightly, and I clearly saw the ace land.
The cards fell in the same order as arranged. To
that I would have sworn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Five dollars now that any one card is not the
ace,&#8221; he challenged. &#8220;I shall not touch them. A
small bet&mdash;just enough to make it interesting. Five
dollars from you, sir?&#8221; He looked at me direct. I
shook my head; I was sternly resolved not to be over
tempted. &#8220;What? No? You will wait another
turn? Very well. How about you, sir?&#8221; to the
Colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go halvers with you, Colonel,&#8221; Bill proposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on,&#8221; agreed the Colonel. &#8220;There&#8217;s the soap.
And foh the honor of the grand old Empire State we
will let our friend pick the ace foh us. I have faith
in those eyes of his, suhs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is scarcely fair, sir, when I am risking
nothing,&#8221; I protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, suh; go ahead,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;It is just
a sporting proposition foh general entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll bet you a dollar on the side that you don&#8217;t
spot the ace,&#8221; the dealer baited. &#8220;Come now. Make
it interesting for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not bet, but since you insist, there&#8217;s the ace.&#8221;
And I turned up the right-end card.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the Eternal, he&#8217;s done it! He has an eye like
an eagle&#8217;s,&#8221; praised the dealer, with evident chagrin.
&#8220;I lose. Once again, now. Everybody in, this time.&#8221;
He gathered the cards. &#8220;I&#8217;ll play against you all,
this gentleman included. And if I lose, why, that&#8217;s
life, gentleman. Some of us win, some of us lose.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
Watch the ace and have your money ready. You can
follow this gentleman&#8217;s tip. I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;s smarter
than me, but I&#8217;m game.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was too insistent. Somehow, I did not like him,
anyway, and I was beginning to be suspicious of my
company. Their minds trended entirely toward
gambling; to remain with them meant nothing
farther than the gaming tables, and I was hungry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to excuse me, gentleman,&#8221; I pleaded.
&#8220;Another time, but not now. I wish to eat and to
bathe, and I have an engagement following.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gad, suh!&#8221; The Colonel fixed me with his fishy
eyes. &#8220;Foh God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t break your winning
streak with eatin&#8217; and washin&#8217;. Fortune is a fickle
jade, suh; she&#8217;s hostile when slapped in the face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill glowered at me, but I was firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will give me the pleasure of taking supper
with me at some good place&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I suggested, as
they pursued me into the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t talk this over while we&#8217;re dry,&#8221; the
Colonel objected. &#8220;That is a human impossibility.
Let us libate, suhs, in order to tackle our provender
in proper spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And no lemonade goes this time, either,&#8221; Bill declared.
&#8220;That brand of a drink is insultin&#8217; to good
victuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were standing, for the moment, verging upon
argument much to my distaste, when on a sudden who
should come tripping along but My Lady of the Blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Eyes&mdash;yes, the very flesh and action of her, her face
shielded from the dust by a little sunshade.</p>
<p>She saw me, recognized me in startled fashion, and
with a swift glance at my two companions bowed.
My hat was off in a twinkling, with my best manner;
the Colonel barely had time to imitate ere, leaving me
a quick smile, she was gone on.</p>
<p>He and Bill stared after; then at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gad, suh! You know the lady?&#8221; the Colonel
ejaculated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the honor. We were passengers upon the
same train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clean through, you mean?&#8221; queried Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We happened to get on together, at
Omaha.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate you, suh,&#8221; affirmed the Colonel.
&#8220;We were not aware, suh, that you had an acquaintance
of that nature in this city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again congratulation over my fortune! It
mounted to my head, but I preserved decorum.</p>
<p>&#8220;A casual acquaintance. We were merely travelers
by the same route at the same time. And now if
you will recommend a good eating place, and be my
guests at supper, after that, as I have said, I must be
excused. By the way, while I think of it,&#8221; I carelessly
added, &#8220;can you direct me how to get to the
Big Tent?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Tent? If I am not intruding, suh, does
your engagement comprise the Big Tent?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But I failed to get the address.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel swelled; his fishy eyes hardened upon
me as with righteous indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suh, you are too damned innocent. You come
here, suh, imposing as a stranger, suh, and throwing
yourself on our goodness, suh, to entertain you; and
you conceal your irons in the fiah under your hat,
suh. Do we look green, suh? What is your vocation,
suh? I believe, by gad, suh, that you are a common
capper foh some infernal skinning game, or that
you are a professional. Suh, I call your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was about to retort hotly that I had not requested
their chaperonage, and that my affair with My Lady
and the Big Tent, howsoever they might take it, was
my own; when Mr. Brady, who likewise had been
glaring at me, growled morosely.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s waitin&#8217; for you. You can square with us
later, and if there&#8217;s something doin&#8217; on the table we
want a show.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black-clad figure had lingered beyond; ostensibly
gazing into a window but now and again darting
a glance in our direction. I accepted the glances
as a token of inclination on her part; without saying
another word to my ruffled body-guards I approached
her.</p>
<p>She received me with a quick turn of head as if not
expecting, but with a ready smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; I uttered foolishly, &#8220;good-evening.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have left your friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very willingly. Whether they are really my
friends I rather question. They have seen fit to escort
me about, is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I have rescued you?&#8221; She smiled again.
&#8220;Believe me, sir, you would be better off alone. I
know the gentlemen. They have been paid for their
trouble, have they not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have won a little at gambling, but in that I
had no hand,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;So far they have asked
nothing more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not. And you put up no stakes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a penny, madam. Why should I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To make it interesting, as they doubtless said.
The Colonel, as all the town knows, is a notorious
capper and steerer, and the fellow Brady is no better,
no worse. Had you stayed with them and suffered
them to persuade you into betting, you would soon
have been fleeced as clean as a shaved pig. The little
gains they are permitted to make, to draw you on, is
their pay. Their losses if any would have been restored
to them, but not yours to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange to say, they have just accused me of being
a &#8216;capper,&#8217;&#8221; I answered, nettled as I began to
comprehend.</p>
<p>&#8220;From what cause, sir?&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p>&#8220;They seemed to think that I am smarter than to
my actual credit, for one thing.&#8221; I, of course, could
not involve her in the subject, and indeed could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
understand why she should have been held responsible,
anyway. &#8220;And probably they were peeved because
I insisted upon eating supper and then following
my own bent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were about to leave them?&#8221; Her face
brightened. &#8220;That is good. They were disappointed
in finding you no gudgeon to be hooked by such raw
methods. And you&#8217;ve not had supper yet? Promise
me that you will take up with no more strangers or,
I assure you, you may wake in the morning with
your pockets turned inside out and your memory at
fault. This is Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, this is Benton, is it?&#8221; I rejoined; and perhaps
bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Benton, Wyoming Territory; of three thousand
people in two weeks; in another month, who knows
how many? And the majority of us live on one another.
The country furnishes nothing else. Still,
you will find it not much different from what I told
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have found it high and dry, certainly,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you stopping?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the Queen&mdash;with a bath for every room. I am
now awaiting the turn of my room, at the end of another
hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She laughed heartily. &#8220;You are fortunate,
sir. The Queen may not be considered the best
in all ways, but they say the towels for the baths are
more than napkin size. Meanwhile, let me advise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
you. Outfit while you wait, and become of the country.
You look too much the pilgrim&mdash;there is Eastern
dust showing through our Benton dust, and that
spells of other &#8217;dust&#8217; in your pockets. Get another
hat, a flannel shirt, some coarser trousers, a pair of
boots, don a gun and a swagger, say little, make few
impromptu friends, win and lose without a smile or
frown, if you play (but upon playing I will advise you
later), pass as a surveyor, as a railroad clerk, as a
Mormon&mdash;anything they choose to apply to you; and
I shall hope to see you to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall,&#8221; I assured, abashed by her raillery.
&#8220;And if you will kindly tell me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The meals at the Belle Marie Café are as good as
any. You can see the sign from here. So adios, sir,
and remember.&#8221; With no mention of the Big Tent
she flashed a smile at me and mingled with the other
pedestrians crossing the street on diagonal course.
As I had not been invited to accompany her I stood,
gratefully digesting her remarks. When I turned for
a final word with my two guides, they had vanished.</p>
<p>This I interpreted as a confession of jealous fear
that I had been, in slang phrasing, &#8220;put wise.&#8221; And
sooth to say, I saw them again no more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;HIGH AND DRY&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The counsel to don a garb smacking less of the recent
East struck me as sound; for although I was not
the only person here in Eastern guise, nevertheless
about the majority of the populace there was an easy
aggressiveness that my appearance evidently lacked.</p>
<p>So I must hurry ere the shops closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon. What time do the stores
close, can you tell me?&#8221; I asked of the nearest bystander.</p>
<p>He surveyed me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Close? Hell!&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don&#8217;t close for
even a dog fight, pardner. Business runs twenty-five
hours every day, seven days the week, in these
diggin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where will I find a haberdashery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A what? Talk English. What you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a&mdash;an outfit; a personal outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blanket to moccasins? Levi&#8217;s, stranger. Levi&#8217;ll
outfit you complete and throw in a yellow purp under
the wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is Levi&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There.&#8221; And he jerked his head aside. &#8220;You
could shut your eyes and spit in the doorway.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>With that he rudely turned his back upon me. But
sure enough, by token of the large sign &#8220;Levi&#8217;s
Mammoth Emporium: Liquors, Groceries and General
Merchandise,&#8221; I was standing almost in front of
the store itself.</p>
<p>I entered, into the seething aisle flanked by heaped-up
counters and stacked goods that bulged the partially
boarded canvas walls. At last I gained position
near one of the perspiring clerks and caught his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. You, sir? What can I do for you,
sir?&#8221; He rubbed his hands alertly, on edge with a
long day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish a hat, flannel shirt, a serviceable ready-made
suit, boots, possibly other matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have exactly the things for you, sir. This
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going out on the advance line, sir?&#8221; he asked,
while I made selections.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not unlikely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re doing great work. Three miles of track
laid yesterday; twelve so far this week. Averaging
two and one-half miles a day and promising better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I understand,&#8221; I alleged.</p>
<p>&#8220;General Jack Casement is a world beater. If he
could get the iron as fast as he could use it he&#8217;d build
through to California without a halt. But looks now
as if somewhere between would have to satisfy him.
You are a surveyor, I take it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am surveying on the line along with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
others,&#8221; I answered. And surveying the country I
was.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the gentlemen who lay out the course,&#8221;
he complimented. &#8220;Now, is there something else,
sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I need a good revolver, a belt and ammunition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We carry the reliable&mdash;the Colt&#8217;s. That&#8217;s the
favorite holster gun in use out here. Please step
across, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not particular as to shine,&#8221; he resumed,
&#8220;we have a second-hand outfit that I can sell you
cheap. Took it in as a deposit, and the gentleman
never has called for it. Of course you&#8217;re broken in
to the country, but as you know a new belt and holster
are apt to be viewed with suspicion and a gentleman
sometimes has to draw when he&#8217;d rather not,
to prove himself. This gun has been used just enough
to take the roughness off the trigger pull, and it employs
the metallic cartridges&mdash;very convenient. The
furniture for it is O. K. And all at half price.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was glad to find something cheap. The boots had
been fifteen dollars, the hat eight, shirt and suit in
proportion, and the red silk handkerchief two dollars
and a half. Yes, Benton was &#8220;high.&#8221;</p>
<p>With my bulky parcel I sought the Belle Marie
Café, ate my supper, thence hastened through the
gloaming to the hotel for bath and change of costume.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>I had yet time to array myself, as an experiment
and a lark; and that I sillily did, hurriedly tossing
my old garments upon bed and floor, in order to invest
with the new. The third bed was occupied when
I came in; occupied on the outside by a plump, round-faced,
dust-scalded man, with piggish features accentuated
by his small bloodshot eyes; dressed in Eastern
mode but stripped to the galluses, as was the custom.
He lay upon his back, his puffy hands folded
across his spherical abdomen where his pantaloons
met a sweaty pink-striped shirt; and he panted
wheezingly through his nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell of a country, ain&#8217;t it!&#8221; he observed in a moment.
&#8220;You a stranger, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been here a short time, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought so. Jest beginnin&#8217; to peel, like me. I
been here two days. What&#8217;s your line?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a number of things in view,&#8221; I evaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t have to tell &#8217;em,&#8221; he granted.
&#8220;Thought you was a salesman. I&#8217;m from Saint
Louie, myself. Sell groceries, and pasteboards on the
side. Cards are the stuff. I got the best line of sure-thing
stock&mdash;strippers, humps, rounds, squares, briefs
and marked backs&mdash;that ever were dealt west of the
Missouri. Judas Priest, but this is a roarer of a burg!
What <i>it</i> ain&#8217;t got I never seen&mdash;and I ain&#8217;t no spring
goslin&#8217;, neither. I&#8217;ve plenty sand in my craw. You
ain&#8217;t been plucked yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. I never gamble.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wish I didn&#8217;t, but my name&#8217;s Jakey and I&#8217;m a
good feller. Say, I&#8217;m supposed to be wise, too, but
they trimmed me two hundred dollars. Now I&#8217;m
gettin&#8217; out.&#8221; He groaned. &#8220;Take the train in a few
minutes. Dasn&#8217;t risk myself on the street again.
Sent my baggage down for fear I&#8217;d lose that. Say,&#8221;
he added, watching me, &#8220;looks like you was goin&#8217; out
yourself. One of them surveyor fellers, workin&#8217; for
the railroad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be so, sir,&#8221; I replied.</p>
<p>He half sat up.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll want to throw a leg, I bet. Lemme tell
you. It&#8217;s a hell of a town but it&#8217;s got some fine
wimmen; yes, and a few straight banks, too. You&#8217;re
no crabber or piker; I can see that. You go to the
North Star. Tell Frank that Jakey sent you. They&#8217;ll
treat you white. You be sure and say Jakey sent you.
But for Gawd&#8217;s sake keep out of the Big Tent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Big Tent?&#8221; I uttered. &#8220;Why so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll sweat you there,&#8221; he groaned lugubriously.
&#8220;Say, friend, could you lend me twenty dollars?
You&#8217;ve still got your roll. I ain&#8217;t a stivver. I&#8217;m
busted flat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that I can&#8217;t accommodate you, sir,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;I have no more money than will see me
through&mdash;and according to your story perhaps not
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you of the North Star. You mention
Jakey sent you. You&#8217;ll make more than your twenty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
back, at the North Star,&#8221; he urged inconsistent. &#8220;If
it hadn&#8217;t been for that damned Big Tent&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and he
flopped with a dismal grunt.</p>
<p>By this time, all the while conscious of his devouring
eyes, I had changed my clothing and now I stood
equipped cap-a-pie, with my hat clapped at an angle,
and my pantaloons in my boots, and my red silk handkerchief
tastefully knotted at my throat, and my six-shooter
slung; and I could scarcely deny that in my
own eyes, and in his, I trusted, I was a pretty figure
of a Westerner who would win the approval, as
seemed to me, of My Lady in Black or of any other
lady.</p>
<p>His reflection upon the Big Tent, however, was the
fly in my ointment. Therefore, preening and adjusting
with assumed carelessness I queried, in real concern:</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the Big Tent? Where is it? Isn&#8217;t
it respectable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Respectable? Of course it&#8217;s respectable. You
don&#8217;t ketch your Jakey in no place that ain&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve a
family to think of. You ain&#8217;t been there? Say!
There&#8217;s where they all meet, in that Big Tent; all the
best people, too, you bet you. But I tell you,
friend&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not finish. An uproar sounded above the
other street clamor: a pistol shot, and another&mdash;a
chorus of hoarse shouts and shrill frightened cries,
the scurrying rush of feet, all in the street; and in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
hall of the hotel, and the lobby below, the rush of still
more feet, booted, and the din of excited voices.</p>
<p>My man on the bed popped with the agility of a
jack-in-the-box for the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fight, a fight! Shootin&#8217; scrape!&#8221; In a single
motion grabbing coat and hat he was out through the
door and pelting down the hall. Overcome by the
zest of the moment I pelted after, and with several
others plunged as madly upon the porch. We had
left the lobby deserted.</p>
<p>The shots had ceased. Now a baying mob ramped
through the street, with jangle &#8220;Hang him! Hang
him! String him up!&#8221; Borne on by a hysterical
company I saw, first a figure bloody-chested and inert
flat in the dust, with stooping figures trying to raise
him; then, beyond, a man bareheaded, whiskered, but
as white as death, hustled to and fro from clutching
hands and suddenly forced in firm grips up the street,
while the mob trailed after, whooping, cursing,
shrieking, flourishing guns and knives and ropes.
There were women as well as men in it.</p>
<p>All this turned me sick. From the outskirts of the
throng I tramped back to my room and the bath.
The hotel was quiet as if emptied; my room was vacant&mdash;and
more than vacant, for of my clothing not
a vestige remained! My bag also was gone. Worse
yet, prompted by an inner voice that stabbed me like
an icicle I was awakened to the knowledge that every
cent I had possessed was in those vanished garments.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>For an instant I stood paralyzed, fronting the
calamity. I could not believe. It was as if the floor
had swallowed my belongings. I had been absent not
more than five minutes. Surely this was the room.
Yes, Number Six; and the beds were familiar, their
tumbled covers unaltered.</p>
<p>Now I held the bath-room responsible. The scoundrel
in the bath had heard, had taken advantage, made
a foray and hidden. Out I ran, exploring. Every
room door was wide open, every apartment blank;
but there was a splashing, from the bath&mdash;I listened
at the threshold, gently tried the knob&mdash;and received
such a cry of angry protest that it sent me to the
right-about, on tiptoe. The thief was not in the
bath.</p>
<p>My heart sank as I bolted down for the office. The
clerk had reinstated himself behind the counter. He
composedly greeted me, with calm voice and with eyes
that noted my costume.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have your bath as soon as the porter
gets back from the hanging, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is,
unless you&#8217;d prefer to hurry up by toting your own
water. The party now in will be out directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the bath,&#8221; I uttered, breathless, in a
voice that I scarcely recognized, so piping and aghast
it was. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been robbed&mdash;of money, clothes, baggage,
everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what at?&#8221; he queried, with a glimmer of a
smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What at? In my room, I tell you. I had just
changed to try on these things; the street fight
sounded; I was gone not five minutes and nevertheless
the room was sacked. Absolutely sacked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he commented evenly, &#8220;is hard luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard luck!&#8221; I hotly rejoined. &#8220;It&#8217;s an outrage.
But you seem remarkably cool about it, sir. What
do you propose to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; He lifted his brows. &#8220;Nothing. They&#8217;re
not my valuables.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is a respectable hotel, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly; and no orphan asylum. We attend
strictly to our business and expect our guests to attend
to theirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told that it was safe for me to leave my
things in my room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not by me, sir. Read that.&#8221; And he called my
attention to a placard that said, among other matters:
&#8220;We are not responsible for property of any nature
left by guests in their rooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the chief of police?&#8221; I demanded.
&#8220;You have officers here, I hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. The marshal is the chief of police, and
he&#8217;s the whole show. The provost guard from the
post helps out when necessary. But you&#8217;ll find the
marshal at the mayor&#8217;s office or else at the North
Star gambling hall, three blocks up the street. I don&#8217;t
think he&#8217;ll do you any good, though. He&#8217;s not likely
to bother with small matters, especially when he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
dealing faro bank. He has an interest in the North
Star. You&#8217;ll never see your property again. Take
my word for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t? Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve played the gudgeon for somebody; that&#8217;s
all. Easiest thing in the world for a smart gentleman
to slip into your room while you were absent, go
through it, and make his getaway by the end of the
hall, out over the kitchen roof. It&#8217;s been done many
a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A traveling salesman saw me dressing. He went
out before me but he might have doubled,&#8221; I gasped.
&#8220;He had one of the beds&mdash;who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know him, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A round-bellied, fat-faced man&mdash;sold groceries
and playing cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no such guest in your room, sir. You
have bed Number One, bed Number Two is assigned
to Mr. Bill Brady, who doubtless will be in soon.
Number Three is temporarily vacant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man said he was about to catch the train
east,&#8221; I pursued desperately. &#8220;A round-bellied, fat-faced
man in pink striped shirt&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was to catch any train, that train has just
pulled out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who was in the bath, ten or fifteen minutes
ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife, sir; and still there. She has to take her
chances like everybody else. No, sir; you&#8217;ve been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
done. You may find your clothes, but I doubt it.
You are next upon the bath list.&#8221; And he became
all business. &#8220;The porter will carry up the water
and notify you. You are allowed twenty minutes.
That is satisfactory?&#8221;</p>
<p>A bath, now!</p>
<p>&#8220;No, certainly not,&#8221; I blurted. &#8220;I have no time
nor inclination for a bath, at present. And,&#8221; I faltered,
ashamed, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to ask you to refund me
the dollar and a half. I haven&#8217;t a cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the circumstances I can do that, although
it is against our rules,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Here it is, sir.
We wish to accommodate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And will you advance me twenty dollars, say,
until I shall have procured funds from the East?&#8221; I
ventured.</p>
<p>A mask fell over his face. He slightly smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; I cannot. We never advance money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to have money, to tide me over,
man,&#8221; I pleaded. &#8220;This dollar and a half will barely
pay for a meal. I can give you references&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From Colonel Sunderson, may I ask?&#8221; His
voice was poised tentatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I never saw the Colonel before. My references
are Eastern. My father&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a gentleman the Colonel is O. K.,&#8221; he smoothly
interrupted. &#8220;I do not question his integrity, nor
your father&#8217;s. But we never advance money. It is
against the policy of the house.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Has my trunk come up yet?&#8221; I queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. If you&#8217;d rather have it in your
room&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In my room!&#8221; said I. &#8220;No! Else it might walk
out the hall window, too. You have it safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly, except in case of burglary or fire. It
is out of the weather. We&#8217;re not responsible for
theft or fire, you understand. Not in Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; I ejaculated, weak. &#8220;You have
my trunk, you say? Very good. Will you advance
me twenty dollars and keep the trunk as security?
That, I think, is a sporting proposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>He eyed me up and down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a surveyor? Connected with the
road?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your business, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a damned fool,&#8221; I confessed. &#8220;I&#8217;m a gudgeon&mdash;I&#8217;m
a come-on. In fact, as I&#8217;ve said before,
I&#8217;m out here looking for health, where it&#8217;s high and
dry.&#8221; He smiled. &#8220;And high and dry I&#8217;m landed in
short order. But the trunk&#8217;s not empty. Will you
keep it and lend me twenty dollars? I presume that
trunk and contents are worth two hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll speak with the porter,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>By the lapse of time between his departure and his
return he and the gnome evidently had hefted the
trunk and viewed it at all angles. Now he came back
with quick step.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; we&#8217;ll advance you twenty dollars on
your trunk. Here is the money, sir.&#8221; He wrote, and
passed me a slip of paper also. &#8220;And your receipt.
When you pay the twenty dollars, if within thirty
days, you can have your trunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if not?&#8221; I asked uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be privileged to dispose of it. We are
not in the pawn business, but we have trunks piled to
the ceiling in our storeroom, left by gentlemen in
embarrassed circumstances like yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>I never saw that trunk again, either. However, of
this, more anon. At that juncture I was only too glad
to get the twenty dollars, pending the time when I
should be recouped from home; for I could see that
to be stranded &#8220;high and dry&#8221; in Benton City of
Wyoming Territory would be a dire situation. And
I could not hope for much from home. It was a bitter
dose to have to ask for further help. Three years
returned from the war my father had scarcely yet
been enabled to gather the loose ends of his former
affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now if you will direct me to the telegraph office&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;The telegraph into Benton is the Union Pacific
Railroad line,&#8221; he informed; &#8220;and that is open to only
Government and official business. If you wish to
send a private dispatch you should forward it by post
to Cheyenne, one hundred and seventy-five miles,
where it will be put on the Overland branch line for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
the East by way of Denver. The rate to New York
is eight dollars, prepaid.&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew that my face fell. Eight dollars would
make a large hole in my slender funds&mdash;I had been
foolish not to have borrowed fifty dollars on the
trunk. So I decided to write instead of telegraph;
and with him watching me I endeavored to speak
lightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. Now where will I find the place
known as the Big Tent?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed with peculiar emphasis.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had mentioned the Big Tent sooner you&#8217;d
have got no twenty dollars from me, sir. Not that
I&#8217;ve anything against it, understand. It&#8217;s all right,
everybody goes there; perfectly legitimate. I go
there myself. And you may redeem your trunk to-morrow
and be buying champagne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am to meet a friend at the Big Tent,&#8221; I stiffly
explained. &#8220;Further than that I have no business
there. I know nothing whatever about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, sir. No offense intended.
The Big Tent is highly regarded&mdash;a great place to
spend a pleasant evening. All Benton indulges. I
wish you the best of luck, sir. You are heeled, I see.
No one will take you for a pilgrim.&#8221; Despite the assertion
there was a twinkle in his eye. &#8220;You will
find the Big Tent one block and a half down this
street. You cannot miss it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>I GO TO RENDEZVOUS</h3>
</div>

<p>The hotel lamps were being lighted by the gnome
porter. When I stepped outside twilight had deepened
into dusk, the air was almost frosty, and this
main street had been made garish by its nightly illumination.</p>
<p>It was a strange sight, as I paused for a moment
upon the plank veranda. The near vicinity resembled
a fair. As if inspired by the freshness and coolness
of the new air the people were trooping to and fro
more restlessly than ever, and in greater numbers.
All up and down the street coal-oil torches or flambeaus,
ruddily embossing the heads of the players and
onlookers, flared like votive braziers above the open-air
gambling games; there were even smoked-chimney
lamps, and candles, set on pedestals, signalizing
other centers. The walls of the tent store-buildings
glowed spectral from the lights to be glimpsed
through doorways and windows, and grotesque, gigantic
figures flitted in silhouette. While through the
interstices between the buildings I might see other
structures, ranging from those of tolerable size to
simple wall tents and makeshift shacks, eerily shadowed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>The noise had, if anything, redoubled. To the exclamations,
the riotous shouts and whoops, the general
gay vociferations and the footsteps of a busy people,
the harangues of the barkers, the more distant
puffing and shrieking of the locomotives at the railroad
yards, the hammering where men and boys
worked by torchlight, and now and then a revolver
shot, there had been added the inciting music of
stringed instruments, cymbals, and such&mdash;some in
dance measures, some solo, while immediately at hand
sounded the shuffling stamp of waltz, hoe-down and
cotillion.</p>
<p>Night at Benton plainly had begun with a gusto.
It stirred one&#8217;s blood. It called&mdash;it summoned with
such a promise of variety, of adventure, of flotsam
and jetsam and shuttlecock of chances, that I, a youth
with twenty-one dollars and a half at disposal, all his
clothes on his back, a man&#8217;s weapon at his belt, and
an appointment with a lady as his future, forgetful
of past and courageous in present, strode confidently,
even recklessly down, as eager as one to the manners
of the country born.</p>
<p>The mysterious allusions to the Big Tent now
piqued me. It was a rendezvous, popular, I deemed,
and respectable, as assured. An amusement place,
judging by the talk; superior, undoubtedly, to other
resorts that I may have noted. I was well equipped
to test it out, for I had little to lose, even time was of
no moment, and I possessed a friend at court, there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
whom I had interested and who very agreeably interested
me. This single factor would have glorified
with a halo any tent, big or little, in Benton.</p>
<p>There was no need for me to inquire my way to the
Big Tent. Upon pushing along down the street, beset
upon my course by many sights and proffered allurements,
and keenly alive to the romance of that
hurly-burly of pleasure and business combined here
two thousand miles west of New York, always expectant
of my goal I was attracted by music again,
just ahead, from an orchestra. I saw a large canvas
sign&mdash;The Big Tent&mdash;suspended in the full shine of
a locomotive reflector. Beneath it the people were
streaming into the wide entrance to a great canvas
hall.</p>
<p>Quickening my pace in accord with the increased
pace of the throng, presently I likewise entered, unchallenged
for any admission fee. Once across the
threshold, I halted, taken all aback by the hubbub and
the kaleidoscopic spectacle that beat upon my ears and
eyes.</p>
<p>The interior, high ceilinged to the ridged roof, was
unbroken by supports. It was lighted by two score
of lamps and reflectors in brackets along the walls and
hanging as chandeliers from the rafters. The floor,
of planed boards, already teemed with men and
women and children&mdash;along one side there was an ornate
bar glittering with cut glass and silver and
backed by a large plate mirror that repeated the lights,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
the people, the glasses, decanters and pitchers, and
the figures of the white-coated, busy bartenders.</p>
<p>At the farther end of the room a stringed orchestra
was stationed upon a platform, while to the bidding
of the music women, and men with hats upon their
heads and cigars in mouths, and men together,
whirled in couples, so that the floor trembled to the
boot heels. Scattered thickly over the intervening
space there were games of chance, every description,
surrounded by groups looking on or playing.
Through the atmosphere blue with the smoke
women, many of them lavishly costumed as if for a
ball, strolled risking or responding to gallantries.
The garb of the men themselves ran the scale: from
the comme il faut of slender shoes, fashionably cut
coats and pantaloons, and modish cravats, through the
campaign uniforms of army officers and enlisted men,
to the frontier corduroy and buckskin of surveyors
and adventurers, the flannel shirts, red, blue and gray,
the jeans and cowhide boots of trainmen, teamsters,
graders, miners, and all.</p>
<p>From nearly every waist dangled a revolver. I remarked
that not a few of the women displayed little
weapons as in bravado.</p>
<p>What with the music, the stamp of the dancers, the
clink of glasses and the ice in pitchers, the rattle of
dice, the slap of cards and currency, the announcements
of the dealers, the clap-trap of barkers and
monte spielers, the general chatter of voices, one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
such as I, a newcomer, scarcely knew which way to
turn.</p>
<p>Altogether this was an amusement palace which,
though rough of exterior, eclipsed the best of the
Bowery and might be found elsewhere, I imagined,
not short of San Francisco.</p>
<p>From the jostle of the doorway to pick out upon
the floor any single figure and follow it was well-nigh
impossible. Not seeing my Lady in Black, at
first sight&mdash;not being certain of her, that is, for there
were a number of black dresses&mdash;I moved on in. It
might be that she was among the dancers, where, as
I could determine by the vista, beauty appeared to be
whirling around in the embrace of the whiskered
beast.</p>
<p>Then, as I advanced resolutely among the gaming
tables, I felt a cuff upon the shoulder and heard a
bluff voice in my ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, old hoss. How are tricks by this
time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Facing about quickly with apprehension of having
been spotted by another capper, if not Bill Brady himself
(for the voice was not Colonel Sunderson&#8217;s unctuous
tones) I saw Jim of the Sidney station platform
and the railway coach fracas.</p>
<p>He was grinning affably, apparently none the worse
for wear save a slightly swollen lower lip; he seemed
in good humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake,&#8221; he proffered, extending his hand. &#8220;No
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
hard feelin&#8217;s here. I&#8217;m no Injun. You knocked the
red-eye out o&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shook hands with him, and again he slapped me
upon the shoulder. &#8220;Hardly knowed you in that
new rig. Now you&#8217;re talkin&#8217;. That&#8217;s sense. Well;
how you comin&#8217; on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First rate,&#8221; I assured, not a little nonplussed by
this greeting from a man whom I had knocked down,
tipsy drunk, only a few hours before. But evidently
he was a seasoned customer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bucked the tiger a leetle, I reckon?&#8221; And he
leered cunningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I rarely gamble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, tell that to the marines.&#8221; Once more he
jovially clapped me. &#8220;A young gent like you has to
take a fling now and then. Hell, this is Benton,
where everything goes and nobody the worse for it.
You bet yuh! Trail along with me. Let&#8217;s likker.
Then I&#8217;ll show you the ropes. I like your style. Yes,
sir; I know a man when I see him.&#8221; And he swore
freely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another time, sir,&#8221; I begged off. &#8220;I have an engagement
this evening&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O&#8217; course you have. Don&#8217;t I know that, too, by
Gawd? The when, where and who? Didn&#8217;t she tell
me to keep my eyes skinned for you, and to cotton to
you when you come in? We&#8217;ll find her, after we
likker up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? Ain&#8217;t I a friend o&#8217; hern? You bet!
Finest little woman in Benton. Trail to the trough
along with me, pardner, and name your favor-ite.
I&#8217;ve got a thirst like a Sioux buck with a robe to
trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not drink, thank you,&#8221; I essayed; but
he would have none of it. He seized me by the arm
and hustled me on.</p>
<p>&#8220;O&#8217; course you&#8217;ll drink. Any gent I ax to drink
has gotto drink. Name your pizen&mdash;make it champagne,
if that&#8217;s your brand. But the drinks are on
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>So willy-nilly I was brought to the bar, where the
line of men already loafing there made space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight goods and the best you&#8217;ve got,&#8221; my self-appointed
pilot blared. &#8220;None o&#8217; your agency whiskey,
either. What&#8217;s yourn?&#8221; he asked of me.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same as yours, sir,&#8221; I bravely replied.</p>
<p>With never a word the bartender shoved bottle and
glasses to us. Jim rather unsteadily filled; I emulated,
but to scanter measure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s how,&#8221; he volunteered. &#8220;May you never
see the back of your neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your health,&#8221; I responded.</p>
<p>We drank. The stuff may have been pure; at least
it was stout and cut fiery way down my unwonted
throat; the one draught infused me with a swagger
and a sudden rosy view of life through a temporary
mist of watering eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A-ah! That puts guts into a man,&#8221; quoth Jim.
&#8220;Shall we have another? One more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now. The next shall be on me. Let&#8217;s look
around,&#8221; I gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find her,&#8221; he promised. &#8220;Take a stroll.
I&#8217;ll steer you right. Have a seegar, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>As smoking vied with drinking, here in the Big
Tent where even the dancers cavorted with lighted
cigars in their mouths, I saw fit to humor him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cigars it shall be, then. But I&#8217;ll pay.&#8221; And to
my nod the bartender set out a box, from which we
selected at twenty-five cents each. With my own
&#8220;seegar&#8221; cocked up between my lips, and my revolver
adequately heavy at my belt, I suffered the
guidance of the importunate Jim.</p>
<p>We wended leisurely among games of infinite variety:
keno, rondo coolo, poker, faro, roulette, monte,
chuck-a-luck, wheels of fortune&mdash;advertised, some, by
their barkers, but the better class (if there is such a
distinction) presided over by remarkably quiet, white-faced,
nimble-fingered, steady-eyed gentry in irreproachable
garb running much to white shirts, black
pantaloons, velvet waistcoats, and polished boots, and
diamonds and gold chains worn unaffectedly; low-voiced
gentry, these, protected, it would appear,
mainly by their lookouts perched at their sides with
eyes alert to read faces and to watch the play.</p>
<p>We had by no means completed the tour, interrupted
by many jests and nods exchanged between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Jim and sundry of the patrons, when we indeed met
My Lady. She detached herself, as if cognizant of
our approach, from a little group of four or five
standing upon the floor; and turned for me with hand
outstretched, a gratifying flush upon her spirited
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are here, then?&#8221; she greeted.</p>
<p>I made a leg, with my best bow, not omitting to
remove hat and cigar, while agreeably conscious of
her approving gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am here, madam, in the Big Tent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her small warm hand acted as if unreservedly
mine, for the moment. About her there was a tingling
element of the friendly, even of the intimate.
She was a haven in a strange coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Told you I&#8217;d find him, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221; Jim asserted&mdash;the
bystanders listening curiously. &#8220;There he was,
lookin&#8217; as lonesome as a two-bit piece on a poker table
in a sky-limit game. So we had a drink and a seegar,
and been makin&#8217; the grand tower.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You got your outfit, I see,&#8221; she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Am I correct?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have saved yourself annoyance. You&#8217;ll do,&#8221;
she nodded. &#8220;Have you played yet? Win, or
lose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not come to play, madam,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Not
at table, that is.&#8221; Whereupon I must have returned
her gaze so glowingly as to embarrass her. Yet she
was not displeased; and in that costume and with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
that liquor still coursing through my veins I felt equal
to any retort.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you should play. You are heeled?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The best I could procure.&#8221; I let my hand rest
casually upon my revolver butt.</p>
<p>She laughed merrily. There were smiles aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; I didn&#8217;t mean that. You are heeled for
all to see. I meant, you have funds? You didn&#8217;t
come here too light, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am prepared for all emergencies, madam, certainly,&#8221;
I averred with proper dignity. Not for the
world would I have confessed otherwise. Sooth to
say, I had the sensation of boundless wealth. The
affair at the hotel did not bother me, now. Here in
the Big Tent prosperity reigned. Money, money,
money was passing back and forth, carelessly shoved
out and carelessly pocketed or piled up, while the
band played and the people laughed and drank and
danced and bragged and staked, and laughed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is good. Shall we walk a little? And when
you play&mdash;come here.&#8221; We stepped apart from the
listeners. &#8220;When you play, follow the lead of Jim.
He&#8217;ll not lose, and I intend that you shan&#8217;t, either.
But you must play, for the sport of it. Everybody
games, in Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I judge, madam,&#8221; I assented. &#8220;Under your
chaperonage I am ready to take any risks, the gaming
table being among the least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prettily said, sir,&#8221; she complimented. &#8220;And you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
won&#8217;t lose. No,&#8221; she repeated suggestively, &#8220;you
won&#8217;t lose, with me looking out for you. Jim bears
you no ill will. He recognizes a man when he meets
him, even when the proof is uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For that little episode on the train I ask no reward,
madam,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not.&#8221; Her tone waxed impatient.
&#8220;However, you&#8217;re a stranger in Benton and strangers
do not always fare well.&#8221; In this she spoke the truth.
&#8220;As a resident I claim the honors. Let us be old acquaintances.
Shall we walk? Or would you rather
dance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d cut a sorry figure dancing in boots,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Therefore I&#8217;d really prefer to walk, if all the same
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for having mercy on my poor feet.
Walk we will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I get you some refreshment?&#8221; I hazarded.
&#8220;A lemonade&mdash;or something stronger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for you, sir; not again,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;You
are, as Jim would say, &#8217;fortified.&#8217; And I shall need
all my wits to keep you from being tolled away by
greater attractions.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, she accepted my arm. We promenaded,
Jim sauntering near. And as she emphatically was
the superior of all other women upon the floor I did
not fail to dilate with the distinction accorded me:
felt it in the glances, the deference and the ready
make-way which attended upon our progress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Frankly to say, possibly I strutted&mdash;as a young man
will when &#8220;fortified&#8221; within and without and elevated
from the station of nondescript stranger to that
of favored beau.</p>
<p>Whereas an hour before I had been crushed and
beggarly, now I turned out my toes and stepped
bravely&mdash;my twenty-one dollars in pocket, my six-shooter
at belt, a red &#8217;kerchief at throat, the queen of
the hall on my arm, and my trunk all unnecessary to
my well-being.</p>
<p>Thus in easy fashion we moved amidst eyes and
salutations from the various degrees of the company.
She made no mention of any husband, which might
have been odd in the East but did not impress me as
especially odd here in the democratic Far West. The
women appeared to have an independence of action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we risk a play or two?&#8221; she proposed.
&#8220;Are you acquainted with three-card monte?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indifferently, madam,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But I am green
at all gambling devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall learn,&#8221; she encouraged lightly. &#8220;In
Benton as in Rome, you know. There is no disgrace
attached to laying down a dollar here and there&mdash;we
all do it. That is part of our amusement, in Benton.&#8221;
She halted. &#8220;You are game, sir? What is life but a
series of chances? Are you disposed to win a little
and flout the danger of losing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in Benton to win,&#8221; I valiantly asserted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
&#8220;And if under your direction, so much the quicker.
What first, then? The three-card monte?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the simplest. Faro would be beyond you yet.
Rondo coolo is boisterous and confusing&mdash;and as for
poker, that is a long session of nerves, while chuck-a-luck,
though all in the open, is for children and fools.
You might throw the dice a thousand times and never
cast a lucky combination. Roulette is as bad. The
percentage in favor of the bank in a square game is
forty per cent. better than stealing. I&#8217;ll initiate you
on monte. Are your eyes quick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For some things,&#8221; I replied meaningly.</p>
<p>She conducted me to the nearest monte game,
where the &#8220;spieler&#8221;&mdash;a smooth-faced lad of not
more than nineteen&mdash;sat behind his three-legged little
table, green covered, and idly shifting the cards
about maintained a rather bored flow of conversational
incitement to bets.</p>
<p>As happened, he was illy patronized at the moment.
There were not more than three or four onlookers,
none risking but all waiting apparently upon
one another.</p>
<p>At our arrival the youth glanced up with the most
innocent pair of long-lashed brown eyes that I ever
had seen. A handsome boy he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled, with white teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>My Lady and he seemed to know each other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How goes it to-night, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slow. There&#8217;s no nerve or money in this camp
any more. She&#8217;s a dead one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not have Benton slandered,&#8221; My Lady gaily
retorted. &#8220;We&#8217;ll buck your game, Bob. But you
must be easy on us. We&#8217;re green yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob shot a quick glance at me&mdash;in one look had
read me from hat to boots. He had shrewder eyes
than their first languor intimated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pleased to accommodate you, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;The greenies stand as good a show at this
board as the profesh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you play for a dollar?&#8221; she challenged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll play for two bits, to-night. Anything to start
action.&#8221; He twisted his mouth with ready chagrin.
&#8220;I&#8217;m about ripe to bet against myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>She fumbled at her reticule, but I was beforehand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no.&#8221; And I fished into my pocket. &#8220;Allow
me. I will furnish the funds if you will do the playing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I choose the card?&#8221; said she. &#8220;That is up to
you, sir. You are to learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By watching, at first,&#8221; I protested. &#8220;We should
be partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she consented, &#8220;if you say so. Partners
it is. A lady brings luck, but I shall not always do
your playing for you, sir. That kind of partnership
comes to grief.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am hopeful of playing on my own score, in due
time,&#8221; I responded. &#8220;As you will see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the card, Bob? We&#8217;ve a dollar on it, as
a starter.&#8221;</p>
<p>He eyed her, while facing the cards up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ace. You see it&mdash;the ace, backed by ten and
deuce. Here it is. All ready?&#8221; He turned them
down, in order; methodically, even listlessly moved
them to and fro, yet with light, sure, well-nigh bewildering
touch. Suddenly lifted his hands. &#8220;All
set. A dollar you don&#8217;t face up the ace at first try.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed, bantering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bob! You&#8217;re too easy. I wonder you aren&#8217;t
broke. You&#8217;re no monte spieler. Is this your best?&#8221;</p>
<p>And I believed that I myself knew which card was
the ace.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear me, and there&#8217;s my dollar.&#8221; He coolly
waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yours; ours. Will you make it five?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One is my limit on this throw. You named it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho!&#8221; With a dart of hand she had turned up
the middle card, exposing the ace spot, as I had anticipated.
She swept the two dollars to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adios,&#8221; she bade.</p>
<p>He smiled, indulgent.</p>
<p>&#8220;So soon? Don&#8217;t I get my revenge? You, sir.&#8221;
And he appealed to me. &#8220;You see how easy it is.
I&#8217;ll throw you a turn for a dollar, two dollars, five
dollars&mdash;anything to combine business and pleasure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
Whether I win or lose I don&#8217;t care. You&#8217;ll follow
the lead of the lady? What?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was on fire to accept, but she stayed me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now. I&#8217;m showing him around, Bob. You&#8217;ll
get your revenge later. Good-bye. I&#8217;ve drummed up
trade for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if inspired by the winning several of the bystanders,
some newly arrived, had money in their
hands, to stake. So we strolled on; and I was conscious
that the youth&#8217;s brown eyes briefly flicked after
us with a peculiar glint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours,&#8221; she said, extending the coins to me.</p>
<p>I declined.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed. It is part of my tuition. If you will
play I will stake.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also declined.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t have that. You will at least take your
own money back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only for another try, madam,&#8221; I assented.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case we&#8217;ll find a livelier game yonder,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;Bob&#8217;s just a lazy boy. His game is a
piker game. He&#8217;s too slow to learn from. Let us
watch a real game.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>I STAKE ON THE QUEEN</h3>
</div>

<p>Jim had disappeared; until when we had made way
to another monte table there he was, his hands in his
pockets, his cigar half smoked.</p>
<p>More of a crowd was here; the voice of the spieler
more insistent, yet low-pitched and businesslike. He
was a study&mdash;a square-shouldered, well set-up, wiry
man of olive complexion, finely chiseled features save
for nose somewhat cruelly beaked, of short black
moustache, dead black long wavy hair, and, placed
boldly wide, contrastive hard gray eyes that lent atmosphere
of coldness to his face. His hat was pulled
down over his forehead, he held an unlighted cigar
between his teeth while he mechanically spoke and
shifted the three cards (a diamond flashing from a
finger) upon the baize-covered little table.</p>
<p>Money had been wagered. He had just raked in a
few notes, adding them to his pile. His monotone
droned on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next, ladies and gentlemen. Sometimes I win,
sometimes I lose. That is my business. The play is
yours. You may think I have two chances to your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
one; that is not so. You make the choice. Always
the queen, always the queen. You have only to watch
the queen, one card. I have to watch three cards.
You have your two eyes, I have my two hands. You
spot the card only when you think you can. I meet
all comers. It is an even gamble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim remarked us as we joined.</p>
<p>&#8220;How you comin&#8217; now?&#8221; he greeted of me.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won a dollar,&#8221; My Lady responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I. She did the choosing,&#8221; I corrected.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you would have chosen the same card, you
said,&#8221; she prompted. &#8220;You saw how easy it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy if you know how,&#8221; Jim asserted. &#8220;Think
to stake a leetle here? I&#8217;ve been keepin&#8217; cases and
luck&#8217;s breaking ag&#8217;in the bank to-night, by gosh.
Made several turns, myself, already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait a minute till we get his system,&#8221; she
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you watching, ladies and gentlemen?&#8221; bade
the dealer, in that even tone. &#8220;You see the eight of
clubs, the eight of spades, the queen of hearts. The
queen is your card. My hand against your eyes, then.
You are set? There you are. Pick the queen, some
one of you. Put your money on the queen of hearts.
You can turn the card yourself. What? Nobody?
Don&#8217;t be pikers. Let us have a little sport. Stake a
dollar. Why, you&#8217;d toss a dollar down your throat&mdash;you&#8217;d
lay a dollar on a cockroach race&mdash;you&#8217;d bet that
much on a yellow dog if you owned him, just to show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
your spirit. And here I&#8217;m offering you a straight
proposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a muttered &#8220;I&#8217;ll go you another turn, Mister,&#8221;
Jim stepped closer and planked down a dollar.
The dealer cast a look up at him as with pleased surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, sir? Very good. You have spirit. Money
talks. Here is my dollar. Now, to prove to these
other people what a good guesser you are, which is
the queen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; Jim said confidently; and sure enough he
faced up the queen of hearts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The money&#8217;s yours. You never earned a dollar
quicker, I&#8217;ll wager, friend,&#8221; the dealer acknowledged,
imperturbable&mdash;for he evidently was one who never
evinced the least emotion, whether he won or lost.
&#8220;Very good. Now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>From behind him a man&mdash;a newcomer to the spot,
who looked like any respectable Eastern merchant,
being well dressed and grave of face&mdash;touched him
upon the shoulder. He turned ear; while he inclined
farther they whispered together, and I witnessed an
arm steal swiftly forward at my side, and a thumb
and finger slightly bend up the extreme corner of the
queen. The hand and arm vanished; when the dealer
fronted us again the queen was apparently just as before.
Only we who had seen would have marked the
bent corner.</p>
<p>The act had been so clever and so audacious that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
fairly held my breath. But the gambler resumed his
flow of talk, while he fingered the cards as if totally
unaware that they had been tampered with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, again, ladies and gentlemen. You see how
it is done. You back your eyes, and you win. I find
that I shall have to close early to-night. Make your
hay while the sun shines. Who&#8217;ll be in on this turn?
Watch the queen of hearts. I place her here. I coax
the three cards a little&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he gave a swift flourish.
&#8220;There they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>His audience hesitated, as if fearful of a trick, for
the bent corner of the queen, raising this end a
little, was plain to us who knew. It was absurdly
plain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go you another, Mister,&#8221; Jim responded.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll pick out the queen ag&#8217;in for a dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gambler smiled grimly and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw, sir. These are small stakes. You&#8217;ll
never get rich at that rate and neither shall I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I can set my own limit,&#8221; Jim grumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. But let&#8217;s have action. Who&#8217;ll join this
gentleman in his guess? Who&#8217;ll back his luck? He&#8217;s
a winner, I admit that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gray eyes dwelt upon face and face of our
half circle; and still I, too, hesitated, although my dollar
was burning a hole in my pocket.</p>
<p>My Lady whispered to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;All&#8217;s fair in love and war. Here&mdash;put this on,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
with yours, for me.&#8221; She slipped a dollar of her own
into my hand.</p>
<p>Another man stepped forward. He was, I judged,
a teamster. His clothes, of flannel shirt, belted
trousers and six-shooter and dusty boots, so indicated.
And his beard was shaggy and unkempt, almost
covering his face underneath his drooping
slouch hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stake you a dollar,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two from me,&#8221; I heard myself saying, and I saw
my hand depositing them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all on this gentleman&#8217;s card, remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>We nodded. The bearded man tipped me a wink.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, sir, then, turn the queen if you can,&#8221; the
gambler challenged of Jim.</p>
<p>With quick movement Jim flopped the bent-corner
card, and the queen herself seemed to wink jovially
at us.</p>
<p>The gambler exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God, gentlemen, but you&#8217;ve skinned me again.
I&#8217;m clumsy to-night. I&#8217;d better quit.&#8221; And he
scarcely varied his level tone despite the chuckles of
the crowd. &#8220;You must let me try once more. But I
warn you, I want action. I&#8217;m willing to meet any
sum you stack up against me, if it&#8217;s large enough to
spell action. Shall we go another round or two before
I close up?&#8221; He gathered the three cards.
&#8220;You see the queen&mdash;my unlucky queen of hearts.
Here she is.&#8221; He stowed the card between thumb and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
finger. &#8220;Here are the other two.&#8221; He held them up
in his left hand&mdash;the eight of clubs, the eight of
spades. He transferred them&mdash;with his rapid motion
he strewed the three. &#8220;Choose the queen. I put the
game to you fair and square. There are the cards.
Maybe you can read their backs. That&#8217;s your privilege.&#8221;
He fixed his eyes upon the teamster. &#8220;You,
sir; where&#8217;s your money, half of which was mine?&#8221;
He glanced at Jim. &#8220;And you, sir? You&#8217;ll follow
your luck?&#8221; Lastly he surveyed me with a flash of
steely bravado. &#8220;And you, young gentleman. You
came in before. I dare you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bent corner was more pronounced than ever,
as if aggravated by the manipulations. It could not
possibly be mistaken by the knowing. And a sudden
shame possessed me&mdash;a glut of this crafty advantage
to which I was stooping; an advantage gained not
through my own wit, either, but through the dishonorable
trick of another.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your half from me, if you want it,&#8221; said
Jim, slapping down two dollars. &#8220;This is my night
to howl.&#8221;</p>
<p>The teamster backed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on the same card,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>And not to be outdone&mdash;urged, I thought, by a
pluck at my sleeve&mdash;I boldly followed with my own
two dollars, reasoning that I was warranted in partially
recouping, for Benton owed me much.</p>
<p>The gambler laughed shortly. His gaze, cool and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
impertinent, enveloped our front. He leaned back,
defiant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a chance, gentlemen. I shall not proceed
with the play for that picayune sum before me.
This is my last deal and I&#8217;ve been loser. It&#8217;s make or
break. Who else will back that gentleman&#8217;s luck?
I&#8217;ve placed the cards the best I know how. But six
or eight dollars is no money to me. It doesn&#8217;t pay for
floor space. Is nobody else in? What? Come,
come; let&#8217;s have some sport. I dare you. This time
is my revenge or your good fortune. Play up, gentlemen.
Don&#8217;t be crabbers.&#8221; He smiled sarcastically;
his words stung. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t pussy-in-a-corner. It&#8217;s
a game of wits. You wouldn&#8217;t bet unless you felt
cock-sure of winning. I&#8217;ll give you one minute,
gentlemen, before calling all bets off unless you make
the pot worth while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The threat had effect. Nobody wished to let the
marked card get away. That was not human nature.
Bets rained in upon the table&mdash;bank notes, silver half
dollars, the rarer dollar coins, and the common greenbacks.
He met each wager, while he sat negligent and
half smiled and chewed his unlighted cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the last round, gentlemen,&#8221; he reminded.
&#8220;Are you all in? Don&#8217;t leave with regrets. You,&#8221;
he said, direct to me. &#8220;Are you in such short circumstances
that you have no spunk? Why did you
come here, sir, if not to win? Why, the stakes you
play would not buy refreshment for the lady!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>That was too much. I threw scruples aside. He
had badgered me&mdash;he was there to win if he could; I
now was hot with the same design. I extracted my
twenty-dollar note, and deaf to a quickly breathed
&#8220;Wait the turn&#8221; from My Lady I planked it down
before him. She should know me for a man of decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, sir,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I am betting twenty-two
dollars in all, which is my limit to-night, on the same
right-end card as I stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought that I had him. Forthwith he straightened
alertly, spoke tartly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The game is closed, gentlemen. Remember, you
are wagering on the first turn. There are no splits in
monte. Not at this table. Our friend says the right-end
card. You, sir,&#8221; and he addressed Jim. &#8220;They
are backing you. Which do you say is the queen?
Lay your finger on her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim so did, with a finger stubby, and dirty under
the nail.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the card, is it? You are agreed?&#8221; he
queried us, sweeping his cold gray eyes from face to
face. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have no crabbing.&#8221;</p>
<p>We nodded, intently eying the card, fearful yet,
some of us, that it might be denied us.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, sir, then.&#8221; And he addressed me. &#8220;You
are the heaviest better. Suppose you turn the card
for yourself and those other gentlemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>I obediently reached for it. My hand trembled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
There were sixty or seventy dollars upon the table,
and my own contribution was my last cent. As I
fumbled I felt the strain of bodies pressing against
mine, and heard the hiss of feverish breaths, and a
foolish laugh or two. Nevertheless the silence
seemed overpowering.</p>
<p>I turned the card&mdash;the card with the bent corner,
of which I was as certain as of my own name; I faced
it up, confidently, my capital already doubled; and
amidst a burst of astonished cries I stared dumbfounded.</p>
<p>It was the eight of clubs! My fingers left it as
though it were a snake. It was the eight of clubs!
Where I had seen, in fancy, the queen of hearts, there
lay like a changeling the eight of clubs, with corner
bent as only token of the transformation.</p>
<p>The crowd elbowed about me. With rapid movement
the gambler raked in the bets&mdash;a slender hand
flashed by me&mdash;turned the next card. The queen that
was, after all.</p>
<p>The gambler darkened, gathering the pasteboards.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t both win, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, tone passionless.
&#8220;But I am willing to give you one more
chance, from a new deck.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the response was I did not know, nor care.
My ears drummed confusedly, and seeing nothing I
pushed through into the open, painfully conscious
that I was flat penniless and that instead of having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
played the knave I had played the fool, for the queen
of hearts.</p>
<p>The loss of some twenty dollars might have been a
trivial matter to me once&mdash;I had at times cast that
sum away as vainly as Washington had cast a dollar
across the Potomac; but here I had lost my all,
whether large or small; and not only had I been bilked
out of it&mdash;I had bilked myself out of it by sinking,
in pretended smartness, below the level of a more artful
dodger.</p>
<p>I heard My Lady speaking beside me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221; She laid hand upon my sleeve.
&#8220;You should have been content with small sums, or
followed my lead. Next time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be no next time,&#8221; I blurted. &#8220;I am
cleaned out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was first robbed at the hotel. Now here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she opposed. Jim sidled to us. &#8220;That
was a bungle, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ruefully scratched his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;A wrong steer for once, I reckon. I warn&#8217;t slick
enough. Too much money on the table. But it
looked like the card; I never took my eyes off&#8217;n it.
We&#8217;ll try ag&#8217;in, and switch to another layout. By
thunder, I want revenge on this joint and I mean to
get it. So do you, don&#8217;t you, pardner?&#8221; he appealed
to me.</p>
<p>As with mute, sickly denial I turned away it seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
to me that I sensed a shifting of forms at the monte
table&mdash;caught the words &#8220;You watch here a moment&#8221;;
and close following, a slim white hand fell
heavily upon My Lady&#8217;s shoulder. It whirled her
about, to face the gambler. His smooth olive countenance
was dark with a venom of rage incarnate that
poisoned the air; his syllables crackled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You devil! I heard you, at the table. You meddle
with my come-ons, will you?&#8221; And he slapped
her with open palm, so that the impact smacked.
&#8220;Now get out o&#8217; here or I&#8217;ll kill you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flamed red, all in a single rush of blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she breathed. Her hand darted for the
pocket in her skirt, but I sprang between the two.
Forgetful of my revolver, remembering only what I
had witnessed&mdash;a woman struck by a man&mdash;with a
blow I sent him reeling backward.</p>
<p>He recovered; every vestige of color had left his
face, except for the spot where I had landed; his hat
had sprung aside from the shock&mdash;his gray eyes,
contrasted with his black hair, fastened upon my eyes
almost deliberately and his upper lip lifted over set
white teeth. With lightning movement he thrust the
fingers of his right hand into his waistcoat pocket.</p>
<p>I heard a rush of feet, a clamor of voices; and all
the while, which seemed interminable, I was tugging,
awkward with deadly peril, at my revolver. His fingers
had whipped free of the pocket, I glimpsed as
with second sight (for my eyes were held strongly by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
his) the twin little black muzzles of a derringer concealed
in his palm; a spasm of fear pinched me; they
spurted, with ringing report, but just at the instant a
flanneled arm knocked his arm up, the ball had sped
ceiling-ward and the teamster of the gaming table
stood against him, revolver barrel boring into his very
stomach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand pat, Mister. I call you.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a trice all entry of any unpleasant emotion vanished
from my antagonist&#8217;s handsome face, leaving it
olive tinted, cameo, inert. He steadied a little, and
smiled, surveying the teamster&#8217;s visage, close to his.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have me covered, sir. My hand is in the
discard.&#8221; He composedly tucked the derringer into
his waistcoat pocket again. &#8220;That gentleman struck
me; he was about to draw on me, and by rights I
might have killed him. My apologies for this little
disturbance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bestowed a challenging look upon me, a hard
unforgiving look upon the lady; with a bow he turned
for his hat, and stepping swiftly went back to his
table.</p>
<p>Now in the reaction I fought desperately against a
trembling of the knees; there were congratulations, a
hubbub of voices assailing me&mdash;and the arm of the
teamster through mine and his bluff invitation:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and have a drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll return. You must. I want to speak
with you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>It was My Lady, pleading earnestly. I still could
scarcely utter a word; my brain was in a smother.
My new friend moved me away from her. He answered
for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until we&#8217;ve had a little confab, lady. We&#8217;ve
got matters of importance jest at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw her bite her lips, as she helplessly flushed; her
blue eyes implored me, but I had no will of my own
and I certainly owed a measure of courtesy to this
man who had saved my life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>I ACCEPT AN OFFER</h3>
</div>

<p>We found a small table, one of the several devoted
to refreshments for the dancers, in a corner and unoccupied.
The affair upon the floor was apparently
past history&mdash;if it merited even that distinction. The
place had resumed its program of dancing, playing
and drinking as though after all a pistol shot was of
no great moment in the Big Tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had a narrow shave,&#8221; my friend remarked as
we seated ourselves&mdash;I with a sigh of gratitude for
the opportunity. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t draw quicker you&#8217;d
better keep your hands in your pockets. Let&#8217;s have a
dose of t&#8217;rant&#8217;lar juice to set you up.&#8221; Whereupon
he ordered whiskey from a waiter.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t stand by and see him strike a
woman,&#8221; I defended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, fists mean guns, in these diggin&#8217;s. Where
you from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Albany, New York State.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sized you up as a pilgrim. You haven&#8217;t been
long in camp, either, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But plenty long enough,&#8221; I miserably replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Long enough to be plucked, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>We had drunk the whiskey. Under its warming
influence my tongue loosened. Moreover there was
something strong and kindly in the hearty voice and
the rough face of this rudely clad plainsman, black
bearded to the piercing black eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; of my last cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All at gamblin&#8217;, mebbe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Only a little, but that strapped me. The
hotel had robbed me of practically everything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had, had it? Wall, what&#8217;s the story?&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him of the hotel part; and he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore. You can&#8217;t hold the hotel responsible.
You can leave stuff loose in regular camp; nobody
enters flaps without permission. But a room is a different
proposition. I&#8217;d rather take chances among
Injuns than among white men. Why, you could
throw in with a Sioux village for a year and not be
robbed permanent if the chief thought you straight;
but in a white man&#8217;s town&mdash;hell! Now, how&#8217;d you
get tangled up with this other outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which?&#8221; I queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;That brace outfit I found you with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow is a stranger to me, sir,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I
simply was foolish enough to stake what little I had
on a sure thing&mdash;I was bamboozled into following the
lead of the rest of you,&#8221; I reminded. &#8220;Now I see
that there was a trick, although I don&#8217;t yet understand.
After that the fellow assaulted the lady, my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
companion, and you stepped in&mdash;for which, sir, I owe
you more thanks than I can utter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A trick, you think?&#8221; He opened his hairy mouth
for a gust of short laughter. &#8220;My Gawd, boy! We
were nicely took in, and we desarved it. When you
buck the tiger, look out for his claws. But I reckoned
he&#8217;d postpone the turn till next time. He would
have, if you fellers hadn&#8217;t come down so handsome
with the dust. I stood pat, at that. So, you notice,
did the capper, your other friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The capper? Which was he, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Lord bless you, son. You&#8217;re the greenest
thing this side of Omyha. A capper touched him on
the shoulder, a capper bent that there card, a capper
tolled you all on with a dollar or two, and another
capper fed the come-ons to his table. Aye, she&#8217;s a
purty piece. Where&#8217;d you meet up with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With her?&#8221; I gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. The woman; the main steerer. That
purty piece who damn nigh lost you your life as well
as losin&#8217; you your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the lady with the blue eyes, in black?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the golden hair. Lady! Oh, pshaw!
Where&#8217;d she hook you? At the door?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not speak of her in that fashion, sir,&#8221; I
answered. &#8220;We were together on the train from
Omaha. She has been kindness itself. The only part
she has played to-night, as far as I can see, was to
chaperon me here in the Big Tent; and whatever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
small winnings I had made, for amusement, was
due to her and the skill of an acquaintance named
Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Daily, yep. O&#8217; course. And she befriended
you. Why, d&#8217;you suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps because I was of some assistance to her
on the way out West. I had a little setto with Mr.
Daily, when he annoyed her while he was drunk.
But sobered up, he seemed to wish to make
amends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord!&#8221; My friend&#8217;s mouth gaped. &#8220;Amends?
Yep. That&#8217;s his nature. Might call it mendin&#8217; his
pocket and his lip. And you don&#8217;t yet savvy that your
&#8217;lady&#8217; &#8217;s Montoyo&#8217;s wife&mdash;his woman, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Montoyo? Who&#8217;s Montoyo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The monte thrower. That same spieler who
trimmed us,&#8221; he rapped impatiently.</p>
<p>The light that broke upon me dazed. My heart
pounded. I must have looked what I felt: a fool.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I stammered in my thin small voice of the
hotel. &#8220;I imagined&mdash;I had reason to suspect that
she might be married. But I didn&#8217;t know to whom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Married? Wall, mebbe. Anyhow, she&#8217;s bound
to Montoyo. He&#8217;s a breed, some Spanish, some
white, like as not some Injun. A devil, and as slick
as they make &#8217;em. She&#8217;s a power too white for him,
herself, but he uses her and some day he&#8217;ll kill her.
You&#8217;re not the fust gudgeon she&#8217;s hooked, to feed to
him. Why, she&#8217;s known all back down the line.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
They two have been followin&#8217; end o&#8217; track from
North Platte, along with Hell on Wheels. Had a
layout in Omyha, and in Denver. They&#8217;re not the
only double-harness outfit hyar, either. You can
meet a friendly woman any time, but this one got
hold you fust.&#8221;</p>
<p>I writhed to the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that fellow Jim?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s jest a common roper. He alluz wins, to encourage
suckers like you. &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t his money he plays
with; he&#8217;s on commish. Beginnin&#8217; to understand,
ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the bent card?&#8221; I insisted. &#8220;That is the
mystery. It was the queen. What became of the
queen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho ho!&#8221; And again he laughed. &#8220;A cute trick,
shore. That&#8217;s what we got for bein&#8217; so plumb crooked
ourselves. Why, o&#8217; course it was the queen, once.
You see &#8217;twas this way. That she-male and the capper
in cahoots with her tolled you on straight for
Montoyo&#8217;s table; teased you a leetle along the trail,
no doubt, to keep you interested.&#8221; I nodded. &#8220;They
promised you winnin&#8217;s, easy winnin&#8217;s. Then at Montoyo&#8217;s
table the game was a leetle slack; so one capper
touched him on the shoulder and another marked the
card. O&#8217; course a gambler like him wouldn&#8217;t be up to
readin&#8217; his own cards. Oh, no! You sports were the
smart ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about yourself?&#8221; I retorted, nettled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Me? I know them tricks, but I reckoned I was
smart, too. Then that capper Jim led out and we all
made a small winnin&#8217;, to prove the system. And
Montoyo, he gets tired o&#8217; losin&#8217;&mdash;but still he&#8217;s blind
to a card that everybody else can see, and he calls for
real play so he can go broke or even up. I didn&#8217;t look
for much of a deal on that throw myself. Usu&#8217;ly it
comes less promisc&#8217;yus, with the gudgeon stakin&#8217; the
big roll, and then I pull out. But you-all slapped
down the stuff in a stampede, sartin you had him
buffaloed. On his last shuffle he&#8217;d straightened the
queen and turned down the eight, usin&#8217; an extra finger
or two. Them card sharps have six fingers on each
hand and several in their sleeve, and he was slicker&#8217;n
I thought. He might have refused all bets and got
your mad up for the next pass; but you&#8217;d come down
as handsome as you would, he figgered. So he let go.
&#8217;Twas fair and squar&#8217;, robber eat robber, and we none
of us have any call to howl. But you mind my word:
Don&#8217;t aim to put something over on a professional
gamblin&#8217; sharp. It can&#8217;t be done. As for me, I
broke even and I alluz expect to lose. When I look
to be skinned I leave most my dust behind me where I
can&#8217;t get at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now I saw all, or enough. I had received no more
than I deserved. Such a wave of nausea surged into
my mouth&mdash;but he was continuing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest why he struck his woman I don&#8217;t know. Do
you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. She had cautioned me and he must have
heard her. And she showed which was the right card.
I don&#8217;t understand that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To save her face, and egg you on. Shore! Your
twenty dollars was nothin&#8217;. She didn&#8217;t know you
were busted. Next time she&#8217;d have steered you to
the tune of a hundred or two and cleaned you proper.
You hadn&#8217;t been worked along, yet, to the right pitch
o&#8217; smartness. Montoyo must ha&#8217; mistook her. She
encouraged you, didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she did.&#8221; I arose unsteadily, clutching the
table. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll excuse me, sir, I think I&#8217;d better go.
I&mdash;I&mdash;I thank you. I only wish I&#8217;d met you before.
You are at liberty to regard me as a saphead. Good-night,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Hold on. Sit down, sit down, man. Have
another drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had enough. In fact, since arriving in
Benton I&#8217;ve had more than enough of everything.&#8221;
But I sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were you goin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the hotel. I am privileged to stay there until
to-morrow. Thank Heaven I was obliged to pay in
advance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alluz safer,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And then what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. To-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I must find employment, and earn
enough to get home with.&#8221; To write for funds was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
now impossible through very shame. &#8220;Home&#8217;s the
only place for a person of my greenness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you come out clear to end o&#8217; track?&#8221;
he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was ordered by my physician to find a locality
in the Far West, high and dry.&#8221; I gulped at his smile.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve found it and shall go home to report.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With your tail between your legs?&#8221; He clapped
me upon the shoulder. &#8220;Stiffen your back. We all
have to pay for eddication. You&#8217;re not wolf meat
yet, by a long shot. You&#8217;ve still got your hair, and
that&#8217;s more than some men I know of. You look
purty healthy, too. Don&#8217;t turn for home; stick it
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to stick it out until I raise the transportation,&#8221;
I reminded. &#8220;My revolver should tide
me over, for a beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sell it?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Sell your breeches fust.
Either way you&#8217;d be only half dressed. No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would take me a little way. I&#8217;ll not stay in
Benton&mdash;not to be pointed at as a dupe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;ll remember
you, specially if you&#8217;re known to be broke.
Busted, you&#8217;re of no use to the camp. Let me make
you a proposition. I believe you&#8217;re straight goods.
Can&#8217;t believe anything else, after seein&#8217; your play and
sizin&#8217; you up. Let me make you a proposition. I&#8217;m
on my way to Salt Lake with a bull outfit and I&#8217;m in
need of another man. I&#8217;ll give you a dollar and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
half a day and found, and it will be good honest work,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are teaming west, you mean?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Freightin&#8217; across. Mule-whackin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I never drove spans in my life; and I&#8217;m not
in shape to stand hardships,&#8221; I faltered. &#8220;I&#8217;m here
for my health. I have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stow all that, son,&#8221; he interrupted more tolerantly
than was my due. &#8220;Forget your lungs, lights
and liver and stand up a full-size man. In my opinion
you&#8217;ve had too much doctorin&#8217;. A month with a
bull train, and a diet of beans and sowbelly will put a
linin&#8217; in your in&#8217;ards and a heart in your chest. When
you&#8217;ve slept under a wagon to Salt Lake and l&#8217;arned
to sling a bull whip and relish your beans burned, you
can look anybody in the eye and tell him to go to hell,
if you like. This roarin&#8217; town life&mdash;it&#8217;s no life for
you. It&#8217;s a bobtail, wide open in the middle. I&#8217;ll be
only too glad to get away on the long trail myself.
So you come with me,&#8221; and he smiled winningly. &#8220;I
hate to see you ruined by women and likker. Mule-skinnin&#8217;
ain&#8217;t all beer and skittles, as they say; but this
job&#8217;ll tide you over, anyhow, and you&#8217;ll come out at
the end with money in your pocket, if you choose, and
no doctor&#8217;s bill to pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; I said gratefully, &#8220;may I think it over to-night,
and let you know in the morning? Where will
I find you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The train&#8217;s camped near the wagon trail, back at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
the river. You can&#8217;t miss it. It&#8217;s mainly a Mormon
train, that some of us Gentiles have thrown in with.
Ask for Cap&#8217;n Hyrum Adams&#8217; train. My name&#8217;s
Jenks&mdash;George Jenks. You&#8217;ll find me there. I&#8217;ll
hold open for you till ten o&#8217;clock&mdash;yes, till noon. I
mean that you shall come. It&#8217;ll be the makin&#8217; of
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I arose and gave him my hand; shook with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I hope to come,&#8221; I asserted with glow of
energy. &#8220;You&#8217;ve set me upon my feet, Mr. Jenks,
for I was desperate. You&#8217;re the first honest man I&#8217;ve
met in Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut,&#8221; he reproved. &#8220;There are others.
Benton&#8217;s not so bad as you think it. But you were
dead ripe; the buzzards scented you. Now you go
straight to your hotel, unless you&#8217;ll spend the night
with me. No? Then I&#8217;ll see you in the mornin&#8217;. I&#8217;ll
risk your gettin&#8217; through the street alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may, sir,&#8221; I affirmed. &#8220;At present I&#8217;m not
worth further robbing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except for your gun and clothes,&#8221; he rejoined.
&#8220;But if you&#8217;ll use the one you&#8217;ll keep the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gazing neither right nor left I strode resolutely for
the exit. Now I had an anchor to windward. Sometimes
just one word will face a man about when for
lack of that mere word he was drifting. Of the
games and the people I wished only to be rid forever;
but at the exit I was halted by a hand laid upon my
arm, and a quick utterance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not going? You will at least say good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>I barely paused, replying to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still she would have detained me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no! Not this way. It was a mistake.
I swear to you I am not to be blamed. Please let me
help you. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ve heard&mdash;I don&#8217;t
know what has been said about me&mdash;you are angry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I twitched free, for she should not work upon me
again. With such as she, a vampire and yet a woman,
a man&#8217;s safety lay not in words but in unequivocal
action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; I bade thickly, half choked by that
same nausea, now hot. Bearing with me a satisfying
but somehow annoyingly persistent imprint of moist
blue eyes under shimmering hair, and startled white
face plashed on one cheek with vivid crimson, and
small hand left extended empty, I roughly stalked on
and out, free of her, free of the Big Tent, her lair.</p>
<p>All the way to the hotel, through the garish street,
I nursed my wrath while it gnawed at me like the fox
in the Spartan boy&#8217;s bosom; and once in my room,
which fortuitously had no other tenants at this hour,
I had to lean out of the narrow window for sheer relief
in the coolness. Surely pride had had a fall this
night.</p>
<p>There &#8220;roared&#8221; Benton&mdash;the Benton to which, as
to prosperity, I had hopefully purchased my ticket
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
ages ago. And here cowered I, holed up&mdash;pillaged,
dishonored, worthless in even this community: a
young fellow in jaunty frontier costume, new and
brave, but really reduced to sackcloth and ashes; a
young fellow only a husk, as false in appearance as
the Big Tent itself and many another of those canvas
shells.</p>
<p>The street noises&mdash;shouts, shots, music, songs,
laughter, rattle of dice, whirr of wheel and clink of
glasses&mdash;assailed me discordant. The scores of tents
and shacks stretching on irregularly had become
pocked with dark spots, where lights had been extinguished,
but the street remained ablaze and the desert
without winked at the stars. There were moving
gleams at the railroad yards where switch engines
puffed back and forth; up the grade and the new
track, pointing westward, there were sparks of camp-fires;
and still in other directions beyond the town
other tokens redly flickered, where overland freighters
were biding till the morning.</p>
<p>Two or three miles in the east (Mr. Jenks had
said) was his wagon train, camped at the North
Platte River; and peering between the high canopy of
stars and the low stratum of spectrally glowing,
earthy&mdash;yes, very earthy&mdash;Benton, I tried to focus
upon the haven, for comfort.</p>
<p>I had made up my mind to accept the berth. Anything
to get away. Benton I certainly hated with the
rage of the defeated. So in a fling I drew back, wrestled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
out of coat and boots and belt and pantaloons,
tucked them in hiding against the wall at the head of
my bed and my revolver underneath my stained pillow;
and tried to forget Benton, all of it, with the
blanket to my ears and my face to the wall, for sleep.</p>
<p>When once or twice I wakened from restless
dreaming the glow and the noise of the street seemed
scarcely abated, as if down there sleep was despised.
But when I finally aroused, and turned, gathering wits
again, full daylight had paled everything else.</p>
<p>Snores sounded from the other beds; I saw tumbled
coverings, disheveled forms and shaggy heads. In
my own corner nothing had been molested. The
world outside was strangely quiet. The trail was
open. So with no attention to my roommates I hastily
washed and dressed, buckled on my armament,
and stumped freely forth, down the somnolent hall,
down the creaking stairs, and into the silent lobby.</p>
<p>Even the bar was vacant. Behind the office counter
a clerk sat sunk into a doze. At my approach he
unclosed blank, heavy eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going out,&#8221; I said shortly. &#8220;Number Three
bed in Room Six.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For long, sir?&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be back,
or are you leaving?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m leaving. You&#8217;ll find I&#8217;m paid up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Of course, sir.&#8221; He rallied to the
problem. &#8220;Just a moment. Number Three, Room
Six, you say. Pulling your freight, are you?&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
scanned the register. &#8220;You&#8217;re the gentleman from
New York who came in yesterday and met with misfortune?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, better luck next time. We&#8217;ll see you
again?&#8221; He quickened. &#8220;Here! One moment.
Think I have a message for you.&#8221; And reaching
behind him into a pigeonhole he extracted an envelope,
which he passed to me. &#8220;Yours, sir?&#8221;
I stared at the fine slanting script of the address:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto;  font-style:italic;'><tr><td>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>I CUT LOOSE</h3>
</div>

<p>I nodded; rebuffing his attentive eyes I stuffed the
envelope into my pantaloons pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck. When you come back remember the
Queen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember the Queen,&#8221; said I; and with the
envelope smirching my flesh I stepped out, holding
my head as high as though my pockets contained
something of more value.</p>
<p>The events of yesterday had hardened, thank
Heaven; and so had I, into an obstinacy that defied
this mocking Western country. I was down to the
ground and was going to scratch. To make for home
like a whipped dog, there to hang about, probably become
an invalid and die resistless, was unthinkable.
Already the Far West air and vigor had worked a
change in me. In the fresh morning I felt like a
fighting cock, or a runner recruited by a diet of unbolted
flour and strong red meat.</p>
<p>The falsity of the life here I looked upon as only
an incident. The gay tawdry had faded; I realized
how much more enduring were the rough, uncouth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
but genuine products like my friend Mr. Jenks and
those of that ilk, who spoke me well instead of merely
fair. Health of mind and body should be for me.
Hurrah!</p>
<p>But the note! It could have been sent by only one
person&mdash;the superscription, dainty and feminine, betrayed
it. That woman was still pursuing me. How
she had found out my name I did not know; perhaps
from the label on my bag, perhaps through the hotel
register. I did not recall having exchanged names
with her&mdash;she never had proffered her own name. At
all events she appeared determined to keep a hold
upon me, and that was disgusting.</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t she understand that I was no longer a fool&mdash;that
I had wrenched absolutely loose from her and
that she could do nothing with me? So in wrath renewed
by her poor estimate of my common sense I
was minded to tear the note to fragments, unread, and
contemptuously scatter them. Had she been present
I should have done so, to show her.</p>
<p>Being denied the satisfaction I saw no profit in
wasting that modicum of spleen, when I might double
it by deliberately reading her effusion and knowingly
casting it into the dust. One always can make excuses
to oneself, for curiosity. Consequently I halted,
around a corner in this exhausted Benton; tore the
envelope open with gingerly touch. The folded paper
within contained a five-dollar bank note.</p>
<p>That was enough to pump the blood to my face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
with a rush. It was an insult&mdash;a shame, first hand.
A shoddy plaster, applied to me&mdash;to me, Frank Beeson,
a gentleman, whether to be viewed as a plucked
greenhorn or not. With cheeks twitching I managed
to read the lines accompanying the dole:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Sir</span>:</p>
<p>You would not permit me to explain to you
to-night, therefore I must write. The recent affair
was a mistake. I had no intention that you should
lose, and I supposed you were in more funds. I insist
upon speaking with you. You shall not go away
in this fashion. You will find me at the Elite Café,
at a table, at ten o&#8217;clock in the morning. And in case
you are a little short I beg of you to make use of the
enclosed, with my best wishes and apologies. You
may take it as a loan; I do not care as to that. I am
utterly miserable.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>E.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>To Frank Beeson, Esquire.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Faugh! Had there been a sewer near I believe
that I should have thrown the whole enclosure in, and
spat. But half unconsciously wadding both money
and paper in my hand as if to squeeze the last drop of
rancor from them I swung on, seeing blindly, ready to
trample under foot any last obstacle to my passage
out.</p>
<p>Then, in the deserted way, from a lane among the
straggling shacks, a figure issued. I disregarded it,
only to hear it pattering behind me and its voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Beeson! Wait! Please wait.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>I had to turn about to avoid the further degradation
of acting the churl to her, an inferior. And as I
had suspected, she it was, arriving breathless and
cloak inwrapped, only her white face showing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have my note?&#8221; she panted.</p>
<p>There were dark half circles under her eyes, pinch
lines about her mouth, all her face was wildly strained.
She simulated distress very well indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here it is, and your money. Take them.&#8221; And
I thrust my unclosed fist at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! And you were going? You didn&#8217;t intend
to reply?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not. I am done with you, and with
Benton, madam. Good-morning. I have business.&#8221;</p>
<p>She caught at my sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are angry. I don&#8217;t blame you, but you have
time to talk with me and you shall talk.&#8221; She spoke
almost fiercely. &#8220;I demand it, sir. If not at the
café, then here and now. Will you stand aside,
please, where the whole town shan&#8217;t see us; or do you
wish me to follow you on? I&#8217;m risking already, but
I&#8217;ll risk more.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sullenly stepped aside, around the corner of a
sheet-iron groggery (plentifully punctured, I noted,
with bullet holes) not yet open for business and faced
by the blank wall of a warehouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting since daylight,&#8221; she panted,
&#8220;and watching the hotel. I knew you were still
there; I found out. I was afraid you wouldn&#8217;t answer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
my note, so I slipped around and cut in on you.
Where are you going, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That, madam, is my private affair,&#8221; I replied.
&#8220;And all your efforts to influence me in the slightest
won&#8217;t amount to a row of pins. And as I am in
a hurry, I again bid you good-morning. I advise
you to get back to your husband and your beauty
sleep, in order to be fresh for your Big Tent to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband? You know? Oh, of course you
know.&#8221; She gazed affrightedly upon me. &#8220;To Montoyo,
you say? Him? No, no! I can&#8217;t! Oh, I can&#8217;t,
I can&#8217;t.&#8221; She wrung her hands, she held me fast.
&#8220;And I know where you&#8217;re going. To that wagon
train. Mr. Jenks has engaged you. You will bull-whack
to Salt Lake? You? Don&#8217;t! Please don&#8217;t.
There&#8217;s no need of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am done with Benton, and with Benton&#8217;s society,
madam,&#8221; I insisted. &#8220;I have learned my lesson,
believe me, and I&#8217;m no longer a &#8216;gudgeon.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never were,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Not that. And
you don&#8217;t have to turn bull-whacker or mule-skinner
either. It&#8217;s a hard life; you&#8217;re not fitted for it&mdash;never,
never. Leave Benton if you will. I hate it
myself. And let us go together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam!&#8221; I rapped; and drew back, but she clung
to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, listen! Don&#8217;t mistake me again. Last
night was enough. I want to go. I must go. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
can travel separately, then; I will meet you anywhere&mdash;Denver,
Omaha, Chicago, New York, anywhere you
say&mdash;anywhere&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your husband, madam,&#8221; I prompted. &#8220;He
might have objections to parting with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Montoyo? That snake&mdash;you fear that snake?
He is no husband to me. I could kill him&mdash;I will do
it yet, to be free from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My good name, then,&#8221; I taunted. &#8220;I might fear
for my good name more than I&#8217;d fear a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a name of my own,&#8221; she flashed, &#8220;although
you may not know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been made acquainted with it,&#8221; I answered
roundly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you haven&#8217;t. Not the true. You know only
another.&#8221; Her tone became humbler. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not
asking you to marry me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not asking
you to love me as a paramour, sir. Please understand.
Treat me as you will; as a sister, a friend, but
anything human. Only let me have your decent regard
until I can get &#8217;stablished in new quarters. I
can help you,&#8221; she pursued eagerly. &#8220;Indeed I can
help you if you stay in the West. Yes, anywhere, for
I know life. Oh, I&#8217;m so tired of myself; I can&#8217;t run
true, I&#8217;m under false colors. You saw how the trainmen
curried favor all along the line, how familiar
they were, how I submitted&mdash;I even dropped that coin
a-purpose in the Omaha station, for <i>you</i>, just to test
you. Those things are expected of me and I&#8217;ve felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
obliged to play my part. Men look upon me as a tool
to their hands, to make them or break them. All they
want is my patronage and the secrets of the gaming
table. And there is Montoyo&mdash;bullying me, cajoling
me, watching me. But you were different, after I
had met you. I foolishly wished to help you, and last
night the play went wrong. Why did I take you to
his table? Because I think myself entitled, sir,&#8221; she
said on, bridling a little, defiant of my gaze, &#8220;to promote
my friends when I have any. I did not mean
that you should wager heavily for you. Montoyo is
out for large stakes. There is safety in small and I
know his system. You remember I warned you? I
did warn you. I saw too late. You shall have all
your money back again. And Montoyo struck me&mdash;<i>me</i>,
in public! That is the end. Oh, why couldn&#8217;t I
have killed him? But if you stayed here, so should I.
Not with him, though. Never with him. Maybe
I&#8217;m talking wildly. You&#8217;ll say I&#8217;m in love with you.
Perhaps I am&mdash;quién sabe? No matter as to that. I
shall be no hanger-on, sir. I only ask a kind of partnership&mdash;the
encouragement of some decent man near
me. I have money; plenty, till we both get a footing.
But you wouldn&#8217;t live on me; no! I don&#8217;t fancy that
of you for a moment. I would be glad merely to tide
you over, if you&#8217;d let me. And I&mdash;I&#8217;d be willing to
wash floors in a restaurant if I might be free of insult.
You, I&#8217;m sure, would at least protect me. Wouldn&#8217;t
you? You would, wouldn&#8217;t you? Say something,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
sir.&#8221; She paused, out of breath and aquiver. &#8220;Shall
we go? Will you help me?&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant her appeal, of swimming blue eyes,
upturned face, tensed grasp, breaking voice, swayed
me. But what if she were an actress, an adventuress?
And then, my parents, my father&#8217;s name! I had already
been cozened once, I had resolved not to be
snared again. The spell cleared and I drew exultant
breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible, madam,&#8221; I uttered. &#8220;This is final.
Good-morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>She staggered and with magnificent but futile last
flourish clapped both hands to her face. Gazing back,
as I hastened, I saw her still there, leaning against
the sheet-iron of the groggery and ostensibly weeping.</p>
<p>Having shaken her off and resisted contrary temptation
I looked not again but paced rapidly for the
clean atmosphere of the rough-and-honest bull train.
As a companion, better for me Mr. Jenks. When my
wrath cooled I felt that I might have acted the cad but
I had not acted the simpleton.</p>
<p>The advance of the day&#8217;s life was stirring all along
the road, where under clouds of dust the four and six
horse-and-mule wagons hauled water for the town,
pack outfits of donkeys and plodding miners wended
one way or the other, soldiers trotted in from the military
post, and Overlanders slowly toiled for the last
supply depot before creaking onward into the desert.</p>
<p>Along the railway grade likewise there was activity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
of construction trains laden high with rails, ties,
boxes and bales, puffing out, their locomotives belching
pitchy black smoke that extended clear to the ridiculous
little cabooses; of wagon trains ploughing on,
bearing supplies for the grading camps; and a great
herd of loose animals, raising a prodigious spume as
they were driven at a trot&mdash;they also heading westward,
ever westward, under escort of a protecting detachment
of cavalry, riding two by two, accoutrements
flashing.</p>
<p>The sights were inspiring. Man&#8217;s work at empire
building beckoned me, for surely the wagoning of
munitions to remote outposts of civilization was very
necessary. Consequently I trudged best foot forward,
although on empty stomach and with empty
pockets; but glad to be at large, and exchanging good-natured
greetings with the travelers encountered.</p>
<p>Nevertheless my new boots were burning, my thigh
was chafed raw from the swaying Colt&#8217;s, and my face
and throat were parched with the dust, when in about
an hour, the flag of the military post having been my
landmark, I had arrived almost at the willow-bordered
river and now scanned about for the encampment
of my train.</p>
<p>Some dozen white-topped wagons were standing
grouped in a circle upon the trampled dry sod to the
south of the road. Figures were busily moving
among them, and the thin blue smoke of their fires
was a welcoming signal. I marked women, and children.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
The whole prospect&mdash;they, the breakfast
smoke, the grazing animals, the stout vehicles, a line
of washed clothing&mdash;was homy. So I veered aside
and made for the spot, to inquire my way if nothing
more.</p>
<p>First I addressed a little girl, tow-headed and barelegged,
in a single cotton garment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking for the Captain Adams wagon train.
Do you know where it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>She only pointed, finger of other hand in her
mouth; but as she indicated this same camp I pressed
on. Mr. Jenks himself came out to meet me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray! Here you are. I knew you&#8217;d do it.
That&#8217;s the ticket. Broke loose, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I accept your offer if it&#8217;s still open,&#8221; I
said.</p>
<p>We shook hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wide open. Could have filled it a dozen times.
Come in, come on in and sit. You fetched all your
outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you see,&#8221; I confessed. &#8220;I told you my
condition. They stripped me clean.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rubbed his beard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, all you need is a blanket. Reckon I can
rustle you that. You can pay for it out of your
wages or turn it in at the end of the trip. Fust I&#8217;d
better make you acquainted to the wagon boss. There
he is, yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>He conducted me on, along the groups and fires and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
bedding outside the wagon circle, and halted where a
heavy man, of face smooth-shaven except chin, sat
upon a wagon-tongue whittling a stick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mornin&#8217;, Cap&#8217;n. Wall, I&#8217;m filled out. I&#8217;ve hired
this lad and can move whenever you say the word.
You&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he looked at me. &#8220;What&#8217;s your name,
you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank Beeson,&#8221; I replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t ketch it last night,&#8221; he apologized.
&#8220;Shake hands with Cap&#8217;n Hyrum Adams, Frank.
He&#8217;s the boss of the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Adams lazily arose&mdash;a large figure in his
dusty boots, coarse trousers and flannel shirt, and
weather-beaten black slouch hat. The inevitable revolver
hung at his thigh. His pursed lips spurted a
jet of tobacco juice as he keenly surveyed me with
small, shrewd, china-blue eyes squinting from a broad
flaccid countenance. But the countenance was unemotional
while he offered a thick hand which proved
singularly soft and flatulent under the callouses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to meet you, stranger,&#8221; he acknowledged in
slow bass. &#8220;Set down, set down.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waved me to the wagon-tongue, and I thankfully
seated myself. All of a sudden I seemed utterly
gone; possibly through lack of food. My sigh must
have been remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfasted, stranger?&#8221; he queried passively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, sir. I was anxious to reach the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw! I was about to ask you that,&#8221; Mr. Jenks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
put in. &#8220;Come along and I&#8217;ll throw together a mess
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody goes hungry from the Adams wagon,
stranger,&#8221; Captain Adams observed. He slightly
raised his voice, peremptory. &#8220;Rachael! Fetch our
guest some breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But as Mr. Jenks has invited me, Captain, and I
am in his employ&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I protested. He cut me
short.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have said that nobody, man, woman or child, or
dog, goes hungry from the Adams wagon. The flesh
must be fed as well as the soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were two women in view, busied with domestic
cares. I had sensed their eyes cast now and then
in my direction. One was elderly, as far as might be
judged by her somewhat slatternly figure draped in a
draggled snuff-colored, straight-flowing gown, and by
the merest glimpse of her features within her faded
sunbonnet. The other promptly moved aside from
where she was bending over a wash-board, ladled food
from a kettle to a platter, poured a tin cupful of coffee
from the pot simmering by the fire, and bore them to
me; her eyes down, shyly handed them.</p>
<p>I thanked her but was not presented. To the Captain&#8217;s
&#8220;That will do, Rachael,&#8221; she turned dutifully
away; not so soon, however, but that I had seen a
fresh young face within the bonnet confines&mdash;a round
rosy face according well with the buxom curves of her
as she again bent over her wash-board.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our fare is that of the tents of Abraham, stranger,&#8221;
spoke the Captain, who had resumed his whittling.
&#8220;Such as it is, you are welcome to. We are a
plain people who walk in the way of the Lord, for that
is commanded.&#8221;</p>
<p>His sonorous tones were delivered rather through
the nose, but did not fail of hospitality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ask nothing better, sir,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;And if I
did, my appetite would make up for all deficiencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A healthy appetite is a good token,&#8221; he affirmed.
&#8220;Show me a well man who picks at his victuals and I
will show you a candidate for the devil. His thoughts
will like to be as idle as his knife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mess of pork and beans and the black unsweetened
coffee evidently were what I needed, for I began
to mend wonderfully ere I was half through the
course. He had not invited me to further conversation&mdash;only,
when I had drained the cup he called
again: &#8220;Rachael! More coffee,&#8221; whereupon the
same young woman advanced, without glancing at
me, received my cup, and returned it steaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are from the East, stranger?&#8221; he now inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I arrived in Benton only yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Sodom,&#8221; he growled harshly. &#8220;A tented sepulcher.
And it will perish. I tell you, you do well
to leave it, you do well to yoke yourself with the appointed
of this earth, rather than stay in that sink-pit
of the eternally damned.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you, sir,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I did not find
Benton to be a pleasant place. But I had not known,
when I started from Omaha.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly not,&#8221; he moodily assented. &#8220;The devil
is attentive; he is present in the stations, and on the
trains; he will ride in those gilded palaces even to the
Jordan, but he shall not cross. In the name of the
Lord we shall face him. What good there shall come,
shall abide; but the evil shall wither. Not,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;that we stand against the railroad. It is needed,
and we have petitioned without being heard. We are
strong but isolated, we have goods to sell, and the
word of Brigham Young has gone forth that a railroad
we must have. Against the harpies, the gamblers,
the loose women and the lustful men and all the
Gentile vanities we will stand upon our own feet by
the help of Almighty God.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this juncture, when I had finished my platter of
pork and beans and my second cup of coffee, a tall,
double-jointed youth of about my age, carrying an
ox goad in his hand, strolled to us as if attracted by
the harangue. He was clad in the prevalent cowhide
boots, linsey-woolsey pantaloons tucked in, red flannel
shirt, and battered hat from which untrimmed flaxen
hair fell down unevenly to his shoulder line. He
wore at his belt butcher-knife and gun.</p>
<p>By his hulk, his light blue eyes, albeit a trifle
crossed, and the general lineaments of his stolid,
square, high-cheeked countenance I conceived him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
to be a second but not improved edition of the Captain.</p>
<p>A true raw-bone he was; and to me, as I casually
met his gaze, looked to be obstinate, secretive and
small minded. But who can explain those sudden antagonisms
that spring up on first sight?</p>
<p>&#8220;My son Daniel,&#8221; the Captain introduced. &#8220;This
stranger travels to Zion with us, Daniel, in the employ
of Mr. Jenks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The youth had the grip of a vise, and seemed to enjoy
emphasizing it while cunningly watching my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haowdy?&#8221; he drawled. With that he twanged a
sentence or two to his father. &#8220;I faound the caow,
Dad. Do yu reckon to pull aout to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not decided. Go tend to your duties,
Daniel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel bestowed upon me a parting stare, and
lurched away, snapping the lash of his goad.</p>
<p>&#8220;And with your permission I will tend to mine,
sir,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Mr. Jenks doubtless has work for me.
I thank you for your hospitality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are commanded by the prophet to feed the
stranger, whether friend or enemy,&#8221; he reproved.
&#8220;We are also commanded by the Lord to earn our
bread by the sweat of our brow. As long as you are
no trifler you will be welcome at my wagon. Good-day
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I passed, the young woman, Rachael&mdash;whom I
judged to be his daughter, although she was evidently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
far removed from parent stock&mdash;glanced quickly up.
I caught her gaze full, so that she lowered her eyes
with a blush. She was indeed wholesome if not absolutely
pretty. When later I saw her with her sunbonnet
doffed and her brown hair smoothly brushed
back I thought her more wholesome still.</p>
<p>Mr. Jenks received me jovially.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got your belly full, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a new man,&#8221; I assured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, those Mormons are good providers.
They&#8217;ll share with you whatever they have, for no
pay, but if you rub &#8217;em the wrong way or go to dickerin&#8217;
with &#8217;em they&#8217;re closer&#8217;n the hide on a cold mule.
You didn&#8217;t make sheep&#8217;s eyes at ary of the women?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. I am done with women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And right you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, I could not help but see that the Captain&#8217;s
daughter is pleasing to look upon. I should be
glad to know her, were there no objections.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How? His daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Rachael, I believe. That is the name he
used.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The young one, you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. The one who served me with breakfast.
Rosy-cheeked and plump.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa, man! She&#8217;s his wife, and not for Gentiles.
They&#8217;re both his wives; whether he has more
in Utah I don&#8217;t know. But you&#8217;d best let her alone.
She&#8217;s been j&#8217;ined to him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>This took me all aback, for I had no other idea than
that she was his daughter, or niece&mdash;stood in that
kind of relation to him. He was twice her age, apparently.
Now I could only stammer:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no wish to intrude, you may be sure. And
Daniel, his son&mdash;is he married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That whelp? Met him, did you? No, he ain&#8217;t
married, yet. But he will be, soon as he takes his pick
&#8217;cordin&#8217; to law and gospel among them people. You
bet you: he&#8217;ll be married plenty.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>WE GET A &#8220;SUPER&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>What with assorting and stowing the bales of
cloth and the other goods in the Jenks two wagons,
watering the animals and staking them out anew, tinkering
with the equipment and making various essays
with the bull whip, I found occupation enough; nevertheless
there were moments of interim, or while passing
to and fro, when I was vividly aware of the scenes
and events transpiring in this Western world around
about.</p>
<p>The bugles sounded calls for the routine at Fort
Steele&mdash;a mere cantonment, yet, of tents and rough
board buildings squatting upon the bare brown soil
near the river bank, north of us, and less than a month
old. The wagon road was a line of white dust from
the river clear to Benton, and through the murk plodded
the water haulers and emigrants and freighters,
animals and men alike befloured and choked. The
dust cloud rested over Benton. It fumed in another
line westward, kept in suspense by on-traveling stage
and wagon&mdash;by wheel, hoof and boot, bound for Utah
and Idaho. From the town there extended northward
a third dust line, marking the stage and freighting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
road through the Indian country to the mining
settlements of the famous South Pass of the old Oregon
Trail; yes, and with branches for the gold regions
of Montana.</p>
<p>The railroad trains kept thundering by us&mdash;long
freights, dusty and indomitable, bringing their loads
from the Missouri River almost seven hundred miles
in the east. And rolling out of Benton the never-ceasing
construction trains sped into the desert as if
upon urgent errands in response to some sudden demand
of More, More, More.</p>
<p>Upon all sides beyond this business and energy the
country stretched lone and uninhabited; a great waste
of naked, hot, resplendent land blotched with white
and red, showing not a green spot except the course
of the Platte; with scorched, rusty hills rising above
its fantastic surface, and, in the distance, bluish mountain
ranges that appeared to float and waver in the
sun-drenched air.</p>
<p>The sounds from Benton&mdash;the hammering, the
shouting, the babbling, the puffing of the locomotives&mdash;drifted
faintly to us, merged into the cracking of
whips and the oaths and songs by the wagon drivers
along the road. Of our own little camp I took gradual
stock.</p>
<p>It, like the desert reaches, evinced little of feverishness,
for while booted men busied themselves at
tasks similar to mine, others lolled, spinning yarns and
whittling; the several women, at wash-boards and at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
pots and pans and needles, worked contentedly in sun
and shade; children played at makeshift games, dogs
drowsed underneath the wagons, and outside our circle
the mules and oxen grazed as best they might, their
only vexation the blood-sucking flies. The flies were
kin of Benton.</p>
<p>Captain Adams loped away, as if to town. Others
went in. While I was idle at last and rather enjoying
the hot sun as I sat resting upon a convenient wagon-tongue
Daniel hulked to me, still snapping his ox
goad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haowdy?&#8221; he addressed again; and surveyed, eying
every detail of my clothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy?&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yu know me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name is Daniel, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, &#8217;tain&#8217;t. It&#8217;s Bonnie Bravo on the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, sir,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Whichever you prefer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;laow we pull out this arternoon,&#8221; he volunteered
farther.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m agreeable,&#8221; I responded. &#8220;The sooner the
better, where I&#8217;m concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;laow yu (and he pronounced it, nasally, yee-ou)
been seein&#8217; the elephant in Benton an&#8217; it skinned yu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw all of Benton I wish to see,&#8221; I granted.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won four bits, an&#8217; then yu bet I quit,&#8221; he greedily
proclaimed. &#8220;I was too smart for &#8217;em. I &#8217;laow
yu&#8217;re a greenie, ain&#8217;t yu?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In some ways I am, in some ways I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;laow yu aim to go through with this train to
Salt Lake, do yu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the engagement I&#8217;ve made with Mr.
Jenks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t feel too smart, yoreself, in them new
clothes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. They&#8217;re all I have. They won&#8217;t be new
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yu bet they won&#8217;t. Ain&#8217;t afeared of peterin&#8217;
aout on the way, be yu? I &#8217;laow yu&#8217;re sickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take my chances,&#8221; I smiled, although he was
irritating in the extreme.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s four hunderd mile, an&#8217; twenty mile at a
stretch withaout water. Most the water&#8217;s pizen, too,
from hyar to the mountings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to drink what the rest drink, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;laow the Injuns are like to get us. They&#8217;re
powerful bad in that thar desert. Ain&#8217;t afeared o&#8217;
Injuns, be yu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to take my chances on that, too, won&#8217;t
I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They sculped a whole passel o&#8217; surveyors, month
ago,&#8221; he persisted. &#8220;Yu&#8217;ll sing a different tyune
arter yu&#8217;ve been corralled with nothin&#8217; to drink.&#8221; He
viciously snapped his whip, the while inspecting me as
if seeking for other joints in my armor. &#8220;Yu aim to
stay long in Zion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t planned anything about that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon yu&#8217;re wise, Mister. We don&#8217;t think
much o&#8217; Gentiles, yonder. We don&#8217;t want &#8217;em, nohaow.
They&#8217;d all better git aout. The Saints settled
that country an&#8217; it&#8217;s ourn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a sample, you&#8217;re welcome to live there,&#8221;
I retorted. &#8220;I think I&#8217;d prefer some place else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haow?&#8221; he bleated. &#8220;Thar ain&#8217;t no place as
good. All the rest the world has sold itself to the
devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much of the world have you seen?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a heap. I&#8217;ve been as fur east as Cheyenne&mdash;I&#8217;ve
teamed acrost twice, so I know. An&#8217; I
know what the elders say; they come from the East
an&#8217; some of &#8217;em have been as fur as England. Yu
can&#8217;t fool me none with yore Gentile lies.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I did not attempt, we remained in silence for a
moment while he waited, provocative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mister,&#8221; he blurted suddenly. &#8220;Kin yu
shoot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume I could if I had to. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Becuz I&#8217;m the dangest best shot with a Colt&#8217;s in
this hyar train, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll shoot ye for&mdash;I&#8217;ll shoot ye for
(he lowered his voice and glanced about furtively)&mdash;I&#8217;ll
shoot ye for two bits when my paw ain&#8217;t &#8217;raound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no cartridges to waste at present,&#8221; I informed.
&#8220;And I don&#8217;t claim to be a crack shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn ye, I bet yu think yu are,&#8221; he accused.
&#8220;Yu set thar like it. All right, Mister; any time yu
want to try a little poppin&#8217; yu let me know.&#8221; And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
with this, which struck me as a veiled threat, he
lurched on, snapping that infernal whip.</p>
<p>He left me with the uneasy impression that he and
I were due to measure strength in one way or another.</p>
<p>Wagon Boss Adams returned at noon. The word
was given out that the train should start during the
afternoon, for a short march in order to break in the
new animals before tackling the real westward trail.</p>
<p>After a deal of bustle, of lashing loads and tautening
covers and geeing, hawing and whoaing, about
three o&#8217;clock we formed line in obedience to the commands
&#8220;Stretch out, stretch out!&#8221;; and with every
cask and barrel dripping, whips cracking, voices urging,
children racing, the Captain Adams wagon in the
lead (two pink sunbonnets upon the seat), the valorous
Daniel&#8217;s next, and Mormons and Gentiles ranging
on down, we toiled creaking and swaying up the Benton
road, amidst the eddies of hot, scalding dust.</p>
<p>It was a mixed train, of Gentile mules and the more
numerous Mormon oxen; therefore not strictly a
&#8220;bull&#8221; train, but by pace designated as such. And
in the vernacular I was a &#8220;mule-whacker&#8221; or even
&#8220;mule-skinner&#8221; rather than a &#8220;bull-whacker,&#8221; if
there is any appreciable difference in rôle. There is
none, I think, to the animals.</p>
<p>Trudging manfully at the left fore wheel behind
Mr. Jenks&#8217; four span of mules, trailing my eighteen-foot
tapering lash and occasionally well-nigh cutting
off my own ear when I tried to throw it, I played the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
teamster&mdash;although sooth to say there was little of
play in the job, on that road, at that time of the day.</p>
<p>The sun was more vexatious, being an hour lower,
when we bravely entered Benton&#8217;s boiling main street.
We made brief halt for the finishing up of business;
and cleaving a lane through the pedestrians and vehicles
and animals there congregated, the challenges
of the street gamblers having assailed us in vain, we
proceeded&mdash;our Mormons gazing straight ahead,
scornful of the devil&#8217;s enticements, our few Gentiles
responding in kind to the quips and waves and salutations.</p>
<p>Thus we eventually left Benton; in about an hour&#8217;s
march or some three miles out we formed corral for
camp on the farther side of the road from the railroad
tracks which we had been skirting.</p>
<p>Travel, except upon the tracks (for they were
rarely vacant) ceased at sundown; and we all, having
eaten our suppers, were sitting by our fires, smoking
and talking, with the sky crimson in the west and the
desert getting mysterious with purple shadows, when
as another construction train of box cars and platform
cars clanked by I chanced to note a figure spring
out asprawl, alight with a whiffle of sand, and staggering
up hasten for us.</p>
<p>First it accosted the hulk Daniel, who was temporarily
out on herd, keeping the animals from the
tracks. I saw him lean from his saddle; then he rode
spurring in, bawling like a calf:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Paw! Paw! Hey, yu-all! Thar&#8217;s a woman
yonder in britches an&#8217; she &#8217;laows to come on. She&#8217;s
lookin&#8217; for Mister Jenks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Save for his excited stuttering silence reigned, a
minute. Then in a storm of rude raillery&mdash;&#8220;That&#8217;s
a hoss on you, George!&#8221; &#8220;Didn&#8217;t know you owned
one o&#8217; them critters, George,&#8221; &#8220;Does she wear the
britches, George?&#8221; and so forth&mdash;my friend Jenks
arose, peering, his whiskered mouth so agape that he
almost dropped his pipe. And we all peered, with the
women of the caravan smitten mute but intensely
curious, while the solitary figure, braving our stares,
came on to the fires.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gawd almighty!&#8221; Mr. Jenks delivered.</p>
<p>Likewise straightening I mentally repeated the
ejaculation, for now I knew her as well as he. Yes,
by the muttered babble others in our party knew her.
It was My Lady&mdash;formerly My Lady&mdash;clad in embroidered
short Spanish jacket, tightish velvet pantaloons,
booted to the knees, pulled down upon her yellow
hair a black soft hat, and hanging from the just-revealed
belt around her slender waist, a revolver
trifle.</p>
<p>She paused, small and alone, viewing us, her eyes
very blue, her face very white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Jenks there?&#8221; she hailed clearly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn&#8217; if I ain&#8217;t,&#8221; he mumbled. He glowered at
me. &#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am, right hyar. You want to speak
with me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;By gosh, it&#8217;s Montoyo&#8217;s woman, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; were
the comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can come on closer then, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he
growled. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no secrets between us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Come on she did, with only an instant&#8217;s hesitation
and a little compression of the lips. She swept our
group fearlessly&mdash;her gaze crossed mine, but she betrayed
no sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to engage passage to Salt Lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With this hyar train?&#8221; gasped Jenks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You are bound for Salt Lake, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For your health, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; he stammered.</p>
<p>She faintly smiled, but her eyes were steady and
wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;For my health. I&#8217;d like to throw in with your
outfit. I will cook, keep camp, and pay you well besides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t no place for a woman, ma&#8217;am. You&#8217;d
best take the stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. There&#8217;ll be no stage out till morning. I
want to make arrangements at once&mdash;with you.
There are other women in this train.&#8221; She flashed a
glance around. &#8220;And I can take care of myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you aim to go to Salt Lake your main holt is
Benton and the stage. The stage makes through in
four days and we&#8217;ll use thirty,&#8221; somebody counseled.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; this bull train ain&#8217;t no place for yore kind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
anyhow,&#8221; grumbled another. &#8220;We&#8217;ve quit roarin&#8217;&mdash;we&#8217;ve
cut loose from that hell-hole yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So have I.&#8221; But she did not turn on him. &#8220;I&#8217;m
never going back. I&mdash;I can&#8217;t, now; not even for the
stage. Will you permit me to travel with you, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; rasped Mr. Jenks. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
do it. It&#8217;s not in my line, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be no trouble. You have only Mr. Beeson.
I don&#8217;t ask to ride. I&#8217;ll walk. I merely ask protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do we,&#8221; somebody sniggered; and I hated him,
for I saw her sway upon her feet as if the words had
been a blow.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m full up. I wouldn&#8217;t take on even
a yaller dog, &#8217;specially a she one,&#8221; Jenks announced.
&#8220;What your game is now I can&#8217;t tell, and I don&#8217;t propose
to be eddicated to it. But you can&#8217;t travel along
with me, and that&#8217;s straight talk. If you can put anything
over on these other fellers, try your luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, wincing. Her hands clenched
nervously, a red spot dyed either cheek as she appealed
to us all. &#8220;Gentlemen! Won&#8217;t one of you
help me? What are you afraid of? I can pay my
way&mdash;I ask no favors&mdash;I swear to you that I&#8217;ll give
no trouble. I only wish protection across.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Pedro? Where&#8217;s Montoyo?&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned quickly, facing the jeer; her two eyes
blazed, the red spots deepened angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;He? That snake? I shot him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What! You? Killed him?&#8221; Exclamations
broke from all quarters.</p>
<p>She stamped her foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I didn&#8217;t have to. But when he tried to
abuse me I defended myself. Wasn&#8217;t that right, gentlemen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right or wrong, he&#8217;ll be after you, won&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question held a note of alarm. Her lip curled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t fear. I&#8217;ll meet him, myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By gosh, I don&#8217;t mix up in no quarrel &#8217;twixt a
man and his woman.&#8221; And&mdash;&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t our affair.
When he comes he&#8217;ll come a-poppin&#8217;.&#8221; Such were
the hasty comments. I felt a peculiar heat, a revulsion
of shame and indignation, which made the present
seem much more important than the past. And
there was the recollection of her, crying, and still the
accents of her last appeals in the early morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that I might find men among you,&#8221; she
disdainfully said&mdash;a break in her voice. &#8220;So I came.
But you&#8217;re afraid of <i>him</i>&mdash;of that breed, that vest-pocket
killer. And you&#8217;re afraid of me, a woman
whose cards are all on the table. There isn&#8217;t a one of
you&mdash;even you, Mr. Beeson, sir, whom I tried to befriend
although you may not know it.&#8221; And she
turned upon me. &#8220;You have not a word to say. I
am never going back, I tell you all. You won&#8217;t take
me, any of you? Very well.&#8221; She smiled wanly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll drift along, gentlemen. I&#8217;ll play the lone hand.
Montoyo shall never seize me. I&#8217;d rather trust to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
wolves and the Indians. There&#8217;ll be another wagon
train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am only an employee, madam,&#8221; I faltered. &#8220;If
I had an outfit of my own I certainly would help
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flushed painfully; she did not glance at me direct
again, but her unspoken thanks enfolded me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the wagon boss,&#8221; Jenks grunted, and spat.
&#8220;Mebbe you can throw in with him. When it comes
to supers, that&#8217;s his say-so. I&#8217;ve all I can tend to, myself,
and I don&#8217;t look for trouble. I&#8217;ve got no love
for Montoyo, neither,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Damned if I
ain&#8217;t glad you give him a dose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Murmurs of approval echoed him, as if the tide
were turning a little. All this time&mdash;not long, however&mdash;Daniel
had been sitting his mule, transfixed and
gaping, his oddly wry eyes upon her. Now the large
form of Captain Adams came striding in contentious,
through the gathering dusk.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he demanded harshly. &#8220;An ungodly
woman? I&#8217;ll have no trafficking in my train.
Get you gone, Delilah. Would you pursue us even
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going, sir,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I ask nothing
from you or these&mdash;gentlemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s the two she&#8217;s after, paw: Jenks an&#8217; that
greenie,&#8221; Daniel bawled. &#8220;They know her. She&#8217;s
follered &#8217;em. She aims to travel with &#8217;em. Oh, gosh!
She&#8217;s shot her man in Benton. Gosh!&#8221; His voice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
trailed off. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t she purty, though! She&#8217;s dressed
in britches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get you gone,&#8221; Captain Adams thundered.
&#8220;And these your paramours with you. For thus
saith the Lord: There shall be no lusting of adultery
among his chosen. And thus say I, that no brazen
hussy in men&#8217;s garments shall travel with this train
to Zion&mdash;no, not a mile of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenks stiffened, bristling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind your words, Adams. I&#8217;m under no Mormon
thumb, and I&#8217;ll thank you not to connect me and
this&mdash;lady in ary such fashion. As for your brat on
horseback, he&#8217;d better hold his yawp. She came of
her own hook, and damned if I ain&#8217;t beginnin&#8217; to
think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I sprang forward. Defend her I must. She
should not stand there, slight, lovely, brave but drooping,
aflame with the helplessness of a woman alone
and insulted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; I implored. &#8220;Give her a chance. You
haven&#8217;t heard her story. All she wants is protection
on the road. Yes, I know her, and I know the cur
she&#8217;s getting away from. I saw him strike her; so
did Mr. Jenks. What were you intending to do?
Turn her out into the night? Shame on you, sir.
She says she can&#8217;t go back to Benton, and if you&#8217;ll
be humane enough to understand why, you&#8217;ll at least
let her stay in your camp till morning. You&#8217;ve got
women there who&#8217;ll care for her, I hope.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>I felt her instant look. She spoke palpitant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have one man among you all. But I am going.
Good-night, gentlemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Wait!&#8221; I begged. &#8220;You shall not go by
yourself. I&#8217;ll see you into safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel cackled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haw haw! What&#8217;d I tell yu, paw? Hear
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By gum, the boy&#8217;s right,&#8221; Jenks declared. &#8220;Will
you go back to Benton if we take you?&#8221; he queried
of her. &#8220;Are you &#8217;feared of Montoyo? Can he
shoot still, or is he laid out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not go back to Benton, and I&#8217;m not afraid of
that bully,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Yes, he can shoot, still; but
next time I should kill him. I hope never to see him
again, or Benton either.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got spunk, anyhow,&#8221; said they. And by
further impulse: &#8220;Let her stay the night, Cap&#8217;n. It&#8217;ll
be plumb dark soon. She won&#8217;t harm ye. Some o&#8217;
the woman folks can take care of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Adams had been frowning sternly, his
heavy face unsoftened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the wife of a gambler named Montoyo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why come you here, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been abusing me, and I shot him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is blood on your hands? Are you a murderess
as well as a harlot?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shame!&#8221; cried voices, mine among them.
&#8220;That&#8217;s tall language.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strangely, and yet not strangely, sentiment had
veered. We were Americans&mdash;and had we been English
that would have made no difference. It was the
Anglo-Saxon which gave utterance.</p>
<p>She crimsoned, defiant; laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not dare bait a man that way, sir.
Blood on my hands? Not blood; oh, no! He
couldn&#8217;t pan out blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You killed him, woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. He&#8217;s likely fleecing the public in the
Big Tent at this very moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what did you expect here, in my train?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little manhood and a little chivalry, sir. I
am going to Salt Lake and I knew of no safer
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She jumped off a railway train, paw,&#8221; bawled
Daniel. &#8220;I seen her. An&#8217; she axed for Mister Jenks,
fust thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you something to stop that yawp. Come
mornin&#8217;, we&#8217;ll settle, young feller,&#8221; my friend Jenks
growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;I have seen Mr. Jenks; I
have also seen Mr. Beeson; I have seen others of you
in Benton. I was glad to know of somebody here. I
rode on the construction train because it was the
quickest and easiest way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And those garments!&#8221; Captain Adams accused.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
&#8220;You wish to show your shape, woman, to tempt
men&#8217;s eyes with the flesh?&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you have me jump from a train in skirts,
sir? Or travel far afoot in crinoline? But to soothe
your mind I will say that I wore these clothes under
my proper attire and cloak until the last moment.
And if you turn me away I shall cut my hair and continue
as a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are for Salt Lake&mdash;where we are of the
Lord&#8217;s choosing and wish none of you&mdash;there is the
stage,&#8221; he prompted shrewdly. &#8220;Go to the stage.
You cannot make this wagon train your instrument.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The stage?&#8221; She slowly shook her head.
&#8220;Why, I am too well known, sir, take that as you
will. And the stage does not leave until morning.
Much might happen between now and morning. I
have nobody in Benton that I can depend upon&mdash;nobody
that I dare depend upon. And by railway, for
the East? No. That is too open a trail. I am running
free of Benton and Pedro Montoyo, and stage
and train won&#8217;t do the trick. I&#8217;ve thought that out.&#8221;
She tossed back her head, deliberately turned.
&#8220;Good-night, ladies and gentlemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Involuntarily I started forward to intercept. The
notion of her heading into the vastness and the gloom
was appalling; the inertness of that increasing group,
formed now of both men and women collected from
all the camp, maddened. So I would have besought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
her, pleaded with her, faced Montoyo for her&mdash;but a
new voice mediated.</p>
<p>&#8220;She shall stay, Hyrum? For the night, at least?
I will look after her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Captain&#8217;s younger wife, Rachael, had stepped
to him; laid one hand upon his arm&mdash;her smooth hair
touched ashine by the firelight as she gazed up into
his face. Pending reply I hastened directly to My
Lady herself and detained her by her jacket sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I bade.</p>
<p>Whereupon we both turned. Side by side we
fronted the group as if we might have been partners&mdash;which,
in a measure, we were, but not wholy according
to the lout Daniel&#8217;s cackle and the suddenly
interrogating countenances here and there.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would take her in, Rachael?&#8221; the Captain
rumbled. &#8220;Have you not heard what I said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are commanded to feed the hungry and shelter
the homeless, Hyrum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Verily that is so. Take her. I trust you with
her till the morning. The Lord will direct us further.
But in God&#8217;s name clothe her for the daylight in decency.
She shall not advertise her flesh to men&#8217;s
eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; I whispered, with a push. Rachael,
however, had crossed for us, and with eyes brimming
extended her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come with me, please?&#8221; she invited.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not afraid of me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I? No. You are a woman, are you not?&#8221; The
intonation was gentle, and sweet to hear&mdash;as sweet as
her rosy face to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; sighed My Lady, wearily. &#8220;Good-night,
sir.&#8221; She fleetingly smiled upon me. &#8220;I thank you;
and Mr. Jenks.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went, Rachael&#8217;s arm about her; other women
closed in; we heard exclamations, and next they were
supporting her in their midst, for she had crumpled
in a faint.</p>
<p>Captain Adams walked out a piece as if musing.
Daniel pressed beside him, talking eagerly. His voice
reached me.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s powerful purty, ain&#8217;t she, paw! Gosh, I
never seen a woman in britches before. Did yu?
Paw! She kin ride in my wagon, paw. Be yu goin&#8217;
to take her on, paw? If yu be, I got room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go. Tend to your stock and think of other
things,&#8221; boomed his father. &#8220;Remember that the
Scriptures say, beware of the scarlet woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel galloped away, whooping like an idiot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, there she is,&#8221; my friend Jenks remarked
non-committally. &#8220;What next&#8217;ll happen, we&#8217;ll see in
the mornin&#8217;. Either she goes on or she goes back. I
don&#8217;t claim to read Mormon sign, myself. But she
had me jumpin&#8217; sideways, for a spell. So did that
young whelp.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was some talk, idle yet not offensive. The
men appeared rather in a judicial frame of mind:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
laid a few bets upon whether her husband would turn
up, in sober fashion nodded their heads over the hope
that he had been &#8220;properly pinked,&#8221; all in all sided
with her, while admiring her pluck roundly denied
responsibility for women in general, and genially but
cautiously twitted Mr. Jenks and me upon our alleged
implication in the affair.</p>
<p>Darkness, still and chill, had settled over the desert&mdash;the
only discernible horizon the glow of Benton,
down the railroad track. The ashes of final pipes
were rapped out upon our boot soles. Our group dispersed,
each man to his blanket under the wagons or
in the open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall,&#8221; friend Jenks again broadly uttered, in
last words as he turned over with a grunt, for easier
posture, near me, &#8220;hooray! If it simmers down to
you and Dan&#8217;l, I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that enigmatical comment he was silent save
for stertorous breathing. Vaguely cogitating over
his promise I lay, toes and face up, staring at the
bright stars; perplexed more and more over the immediate
events of the future, warmly conscious of
her astonishing proximity in this very train, prickled
by the hope that she would continue with us, irritated
by the various assumptions of Daniel, and somehow
not at all adverse to the memory of her in &#8220;britches.&#8221;</p>
<p>That phase of the matter seemed to have affected
Daniel and me similarly. Under his hide he was human.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>DANIEL TAKES POSSESSION</h3>
</div>

<p>I was more than ever convinced of her wisdom in
choice of garb when in early morning I glimpsed her
with the two other women at the Adams fire; for,
bright-haired and small, she had been sorrily dulled
by the plain ill-fitting waist and long shapeless skirt
in one garment, as adopted by the feminine contingent
of the train. In her particular case these were
worse fitting and longer than common&mdash;an artifice
that certainly snuffed a portion of her charms for
Gentile and Mormon eyes alike.</p>
<p>What further disposition of her was to be made
we might not yet know. We all kept to our own tasks
and our own fires, with the exception that Daniel
gawked and strutted in the manner of a silly gander,
and made frequent errands to his father&#8217;s household.</p>
<p>It was after the red sun-up and the initial signaling
by dust cloud to dust cloud announcing the commencement
of another day&#8217;s desert traffic, and in response
to the orders &#8220;Ketch up!&#8221; we were putting
animals to wagons (My Lady still in evidence forward),
when a horseman bored in at a gallop, over
the road from the east.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Montoyo, by Gawd!&#8221; Jenks pronounced, in a
grumble of disgust rather than with any note of
alarm. &#8220;Look alive.&#8221; And&mdash;&#8220;He don&#8217;t hang up
my pelt; no, nor yourn if I can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw him give a twitch to his holster and slightly
loosen the Colt&#8217;s. But I was unburthened by guilt in
past events, and I conceived no reason for fearing
the future&mdash;other than that now I was likely to
lose her. Heaven pity her! Probably she would
have to go, even if she managed later to kill him.
The delay in our start had been unfortunate.</p>
<p>It was dollars to doughnuts that every man in the
company had had his eye out for Montoyo, since daylight;
and the odds were that every man had sighted
him as quickly as we. Notwithstanding, save by an
occasional quick glance none appeared to pay attention
to his rapid approach. We ourselves went right
along hooking up, like the others.</p>
<p>As chanced, our outfit was the first upon his way
in. I heard him rein sharply beside us and his
horse fidget, panting. Not until he spoke did we lift
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, gentlemen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy yourself, sir,&#8221; answered Mr. Jenks,
straightening up and meeting his gaze. I paused, to
gaze also. Montoyo was pale as death, his lips hard
set, his peculiar gray eyes and his black moustache the
only vivifying features in his coldly menacing countenance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>He was in white linen shirt, his left arm slung; fine
riding boots encasing his legs above the knees and
Spanish spurs at their heels&mdash;his horse&#8217;s flanks reddened
by their jabs. The pearl butt of a six-shooter
jutted from his belt holster. He sat jaunty, excepting
for his lips and eyes.</p>
<p>He looked upon me, with a trace of recognition less
to be seen than felt. His glance leaped to the wagon&mdash;traveled
swiftly and surely and returned to Mr.
Jenks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re pulling out, I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you bet yuh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the Adams train?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for my wife, gentlemen. May I ask
whether you&#8217;ve seen her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. We&#8217;ll not beat around any bush over
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He meditated, frowning a bit, eying us narrowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had the notion,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you have staked
her to shelter I thank you; but now I aim to play the
hand myself. This is a strictly private game. Where
is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I call yuh, Pedro,&#8221; my friend answered. &#8220;We
ain&#8217;t keepin&#8217; cases on her, or on you. You don&#8217;t find
her in my outfit, that&#8217;s flat. She spent the night with
the Adams women. You&#8217;ll find her waitin&#8217; for you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
on ahead.&#8221; He grinned. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be powerful glad
to see you.&#8221; He sobered. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll say this: I&#8217;m
kinder sorry I ain&#8217;t got her, for she&#8217;d be interestin&#8217;
company on the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The road to hell, yes,&#8221; Montoyo coolly remarked.
&#8220;I&#8217;d guarantee you quick passage. Good-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>With sudden steely glare that embraced us both he
jumped his mount into a gallop and tore past the
team, for the front. He must have inquired, once or
twice, as to the whereabouts of the Captain&#8217;s party;
I saw fingers pointing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! You&#8217;ve swapped collars on your lead
span, boy,&#8221; Mr. Jenks reproved&mdash;but he likewise
fumbling while he gazed.</p>
<p>I could hold back no longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute, if you please,&#8221; I pleaded; and
hastened on up, half running in my anxiety to face
the worst; to help, if I might, for the best.</p>
<p>A little knot of people had formed, constantly increasing
by oncomers like myself and friend Jenks
who had lumbered behind me. Montoyo&#8217;s horse
stood heaving, on the outskirts; and ruthlessly pushing
through I found him inside, with My Lady at
bay before him&mdash;her eyes brilliant, her cheeks hot,
her two hands clenched tightly, her slim figure dangerously
tense within her absurd garment, and the
arm of the brightly flushed but calm Rachael resting
restraintfully around her. The circling faces peered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>Captain Adams, at one side apart, was replying
to the gambler. His small china-blue eyes had begun
to glint; otherwise he maintained an air of stolidity
as if immune to the outcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She has had the care
of my own household, for I turn nobody away. She
came against my will, and she shall go of her will.
I am not her keeper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You Mormons have the advantage of us white
men, sir,&#8221; Montoyo sneered. &#8220;No one of the sex
seems to be denied bed and board in your establishments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the help of the Lord we of the elect can manage
our establishments much better than you do
yours,&#8221; big Hyrum responded; and his face sombered.
&#8220;Who are you? A panderer to the devil, a
thief with painted card-boards, a despoiler of the ignorant,
and a feeder to hell&mdash;yea, a striker of women
and a trafficker in flesh! Who are you, to think the
name of the Lord&#8217;s anointed? There she is, your
chattel. Take her, or leave her. This train starts on
in ten minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take her or kill her,&#8221; Montoyo snarled.
&#8220;You call me a feeder, but she shall not be fed to
your mill, Adams. You&#8217;ll get on that horse pronto,
madam,&#8221; he added, stepping forward (no one could
question his nerve), &#8220;and we&#8217;ll discuss our affairs in
private.&#8221;</p>
<p>She cast about with swift beseeching look, as if for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
a friendly face or sign of rescue. And that agonized
quest was enough. Whether she saw me or not, here
I was. With a spring I had burst in.</p>
<p>But somebody already had drawn fresh attention.
Daniel Adams was standing between her and her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mister, will yu fight?&#8221; he drawled, breathing
hard, his broad nostrils quivering.</p>
<p>A silence fell. Singularly, the circle parted right
and left in a jostle and a scramble.</p>
<p>Montoyo surveyed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For her, o&#8217; course.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gambler smiled&mdash;a slow, contemptuous smile
while his gray eyes focused watchfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a case where I have nothing to gain,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;And you&#8217;ve nothing to lose. I never bet in the teeth
of a pat hand. Sabe? Besides, my young Mormon
cub, when did you enter this game? Where&#8217;s your
ante? For the sport of it, now, what do you think of
putting up, to make it interesting? One of your
mammies? Tut, tut!&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel&#8217;s freckled bovine face flushed muddy red;
in the midst of it his faulty eyes were more pronounced
than ever&mdash;beady, twinkling, and so at cross
purposes that they apparently did not center upon the
gambler at all. But his right hand had stiffened at
his side&mdash;extended there flat and tremulous like the
vibrant tail of a rattlesnake. He blurted harshly:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;laow to kill yu for that. Draw, yu&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>We caught breath. Montoyo&#8217;s hand had darted
down, and up, with motion too smooth and elusive for
the eye, particularly when our eyes had to be upon
both. His revolver poised half-way out of the scabbard,
held there rigidly, frozen in mid course; for
Daniel had laughed loudly over leveled barrel.</p>
<p>How he had achieved so quickly no man of us
knew. Yet there it was&mdash;his Colt&#8217;s, out, cocked,
wicked and yearning and ready.</p>
<p>He whirled it with tempting carelessness, butt first,
muzzle first, his discolored teeth set in a yellow grin.
The breath of the spectators vented in a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haow&#8217;ll yu take it, Mister?&#8221; he gibed. &#8220;I
could l&#8217;arn an old caow to beat yu on the draw. Aw,
shucks! I &#8217;laow yu&#8217;d better go back to yore pasteboards.
Naow git!&#8221;</p>
<p>Montoyo, his eyes steady, scarcely changed expression.
He let his revolver slip down into its scabbard.
Then he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a pretty trick,&#8221; he commented, relaxing.
&#8220;Some day I&#8217;d like to test it out again. Just
now I pass. Madam, are you coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I&#8217;m not,&#8221; she uttered clearly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your choice of company is hardly to your credit,&#8221;
he sneered. &#8220;Or, I should say, to your education.
Saintliness does not set well upon you, madam.
Your clothes are ill-fitting already. Of your two
champions&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>And here I realized that I was standing out, one
foot advanced, my fists foolishly doubled, my presence
a useless factor.</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;I recommend the gentleman from New York as
more to your tastes. But you are going of your own
free will. You will always be my wife. You can&#8217;t
get away from that, you devil. I shall expect you in
Benton, for I have the hunch that your little flight
will fetch you back pretty well tamed, to the place
where damaged goods are not so heavily discounted.&#8221;
He ignored Daniel and turned upon me. &#8220;As for
you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I warn you you are playing against
a marked deck. You will find fists a poor hand.
Ladies and gentlemen, good-morning.&#8221; With that he
strode straight for his horse, climbed aboard (a trifle
awkwardly by reason of his one arm disabled) and
galloped, granting us not another glance.</p>
<p>Card shark and desperado that he was, his consummate
aplomb nobody could deny, except Daniel,
now capering and swaggering and twirling his revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;I showed him. I made him take water. I &#8217;laow
I&#8217;m &#8217;bout the best man with a six-shooter in these
hyar parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ketch up and stretch out,&#8221; Captain Adams ordered,
disregarding. &#8220;We&#8217;ve no more time for foolery.&#8221;</p>
<p>My eyes met My Lady&#8217;s. She smiled a little ruefully,
and I responded, shamed by the poor rôle I had

borne. With that still jubilating lout to the fore, certainly
I cut small figure.</p>
<p>This night we made camp at Rawlins&#8217; Springs,
some twelve miles on. The day&#8217;s march had been, so
to speak, rather pensive; for while there were the
rough jokes and the talking back and forth, it seemed
as though the scene of early morning lingered in our
vista. The words of Montoyo had scored deeply, and
the presence of our supernumerary laid a kind of incubus,
like an omen of ill luck, upon us. Indeed the
prophecies darkly uttered showed the current of
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a she Jonah we got. Sure a woman the likes
o&#8217; her hain&#8217;t no place in a freightin&#8217; outfit. We&#8217;re off
on the wrong fut,&#8221; an Irishman declared to wagging
of heads. &#8220;Faith, she&#8217;s enough to set the saints
above an&#8217; the saints below both by the ears.&#8221; He
paused to light his dudeen. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be a Donnybrook
Fair in Utah, if belike we don&#8217;t have it along
the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No Mormon&#8217;ll need another wife if he takes her,&#8221;
laughed somebody else.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be promised to Dan&#8217;l &#8217;fore ever we cross
the Wasatch.&#8221; And they all in the group looked slyly
at me. &#8220;Acts as if she&#8217;d been sealed to him already,
he does.&#8221;</p>
<p>This had occurred at our nooning hour, amidst the
dust and the heat, while the animals drooped and
dozed and panted and in the scant shade of the hooded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
wagons we drank our coffee and crunched our hardtack.
Throughout the morning My Lady had ridden
upon the seat of Daniel&#8217;s wagon, with him sometimes
trudging beside, in pride of new ownership, cracking
his whip, and again planted sidewise upon one
of the wheel animals, facing backward to leer at
her.</p>
<p>Why I should now have especially detested him I
would not admit to myself. At any rate the dislike
dated before her arrival. That was one sop to
conscience when I remembered that she was a
wife.</p>
<p>Friend Jenks must have read my thoughts, inasmuch
as during the course of the afternoon he had
uttered abruptly:</p>
<p>&#8220;These Mormons don&#8217;t exactly recognize Gentile
marriages. Did you know that?&#8221; He flung me a
look from beneath shaggy brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;How so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; to say that layin&#8217; on of hands by the
Lord&#8217;s an&#8217;inted is necessary to reel j&#8217;inin&#8217; in marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s monstrous!&#8221; I stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dare say,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It&#8217;s the way white gospelers
look at Injuns, ain&#8217;t it? Anyhow, to convert her
out of sin, as they&#8217;d call it, and put her over into the
company of the saints wouldn&#8217;t be no bad deal, by
their kind o&#8217; thinkin&#8217;. It&#8217;s been done before, I reckon.
Jest thought I&#8217;d warn you. She&#8217;s made her own bed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
and if it&#8217;s a Mormon bed she&#8217;s well quit of Montoyo,
that&#8217;s sartin. Did you ever see the beat of that young
feller on the draw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;I never did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you never will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He says his name&#8217;s Bonnie Bravo. Where did he
find that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haw haw.&#8221; Friend Jenks spat. &#8220;Must ha&#8217;
heard it in a play-house or got it read to him out a
book. Sounds to him like he was some punkins.
Anyhow, if you&#8217;ve any feelin&#8217;s in the matter keep
&#8217;em under your hat. I don&#8217;t know what there&#8217;s been
between you and her, but the Mormon church is between
you now and it&#8217;s got the dead-wood on you.
It&#8217;s either that for her, or Montoyo. He knows; he&#8217;s
no fool and he&#8217;ll take his time. So you&#8217;d better stick
to mule-whacking and sowbelly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still it was only decent that I should inquire after
her. No Daniel and no &#8220;Bonnie Bravo&#8221; was going
to shut me from my duty. Therefore this evening
after we had formed corral, watered our animals at
the one good-water spring, staked them out in the
bottoms of the ravine here, and eaten our supper, I
went with clean hands and face and, I resolved, a
clean heart, to pay my respects at the Hyrum Adams
fire.</p>
<p>A cheery sight it was, too, for one bred as I had
been to the company of women. Whereas during the
day and somewhat in the evenings we Gentiles and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
the Mormon men fraternized without conflict of sect
save by long-winded arguments, at nightfall the main
Mormon gathering centered about the Adams quarters,
where the men and women sang hymns in praise
of their pretensions, and listened to homilies by Hyrum
himself.</p>
<p>They were singing now, as I approached&mdash;every
woman busy also with her hands. The words were
destined to be familiar to me, being from their favorite
lines:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Cheer, saints, cheer! We&#8217;re bound for peaceful Zion!</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Into this domestic circle I civilly entered just as
they had finished their hymn. She was seated beside
the sleek-haired Rachael, with Daniel upon her other
hand. I sensed her quickly ready smile; and with the
same a surly stare from him, disclosing that by one
person at least I was not welcomed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything special wanted, stranger?&#8221; Hyrum demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. I was attracted by your singing,&#8221; I replied.
&#8220;Do I intrude?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, not at all.&#8221; He was more hospitable.
&#8220;Set if you like, in the circle of the Saints. You&#8217;ll
get no harm by it, that&#8217;s certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I seated myself just behind Rachael. A moment
of constraint seemed to fall upon the group. I
broke it by my inquiry, addressed to a clean profile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came also to inquire after Mrs. Montoyo,&#8221; I
carefully said. &#8220;You have stood the journey well,
this far, madam?&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel turned instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s no &#8217;Mrs. Montoyo&#8217; in this camp, Mister.
And I&#8217;ll thank yu it&#8217;s a name yu&#8217;d best leave alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How so, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cause that&#8217;s the right of it. I &#8217;laow I&#8217;ve told
yu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m called Edna now, by my friends,&#8221; she vouchsafed,
coloring. &#8220;Yes, thank you, I&#8217;ve enjoyed the
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rachael spoke softly, in her gentle English accents.
I learned later that she was an English girl, convert
to Mormonism.</p>
<p>&#8220;We Latter Day Saints know that the marriage
rites of Gentiles are not countenanced by the Lord.
If you would see the light you would understand.
Sister Edna is being well cared for. Whatever we
have is hers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will take her on with you to Salt Lake?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is as Hyrum says. He has spoken of putting
her on the stage at the next crossing. He will
decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d rather stay with the train,&#8221; My Lady
murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yu will, too, by gum,&#8221; Daniel pronounced. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
talk with paw. Yu&#8217;re goin&#8217; to travel on to Zion &#8217;long
with me. I &#8217;laow I&#8217;m man enough to look out for ye
an&#8217; I got plenty room. The hull wagon&#8217;s yourn.
Guess thar won&#8217;t nobody have anything to say ag&#8217;in
that.&#8221; His tone was pointed, unmistakable, and I sat
fuming with it.</p>
<p>My Lady drily acknowledged.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very kind, Daniel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, yu see I&#8217;m the best man on the draw in this
hyar train. I&#8217;m a bad one, I am. My name&#8217;s Bonnie
Bravo. That gambler&mdash;he &#8217;laowed to pop me but I
could ha&#8217; killed him &#8217;fore his gun was loose. I kin
ride, wrastle, drive a bull team ag&#8217;in ary man from
the States, an&#8217; I got the gift o&#8217; tongues. Ain&#8217;t afeared
o&#8217; Injuns, neither. I&#8217;m elected. I foller the Lord an&#8217;
some day I&#8217;ll be a bishop. I hain&#8217;t been more&#8217;n middlin&#8217;
interested in wimmen, but I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; old enough,
an&#8217; yu an&#8217; me&#8217;ll be purty well acquainted by the time
we reach Zion. Thar&#8217;s a long spell ahead of us, but
I aim to look out for yu, yu bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>His blatancy was arrested by the intonation of another
hymn. They all chimed in, except My Lady
and me.

<p>They concluded; sat with heads bowed while Hyrum,
standing, delivered himself of a long-winded
blessing, through his nose. It was the signal for
breaking up. They stood. My Lady arose lithely;
encumbered by her trailing skirt she pitched forward
and I caught her. Daniel sprang in a moment, with
a growl.</p>
<p>&#8220;None o&#8217; that, Mister. I&#8217;m takin&#8217; keer of her.
Hands off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bully me, sir,&#8221; I retorted, furious. &#8220;I&#8217;m
only acting the gentleman, and you&#8217;re acting the
boor.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would willingly have fought him then and there,
probably to my disaster, but Hyrum&#8217;s heavy voice
cut in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who quarrels at my fire? Mark you, I&#8217;ll have
no more of it. Stranger, get you where you belong.
Daniel, get you to bed. And you, woman, take yourself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
off properly and thank God that you are among
his chosen and not adrift in sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, sir,&#8221; I answered. And I walked
easily away, a triumphant warmth buoying me, for
ere releasing her strong young body I had felt a note
tucked into my hand.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>SOMEONE FEARS</h3>
</div>

<p>A note from a pretty woman always is a potential
thing, no matter in what humor it may have been
received. The mere possession titillates; and although
the contents may be most exemplary to the
eye, the mind is apt to go hay-making between the
lines and no offense intended.</p>
<p>All the fatuousness that had led me astray to the
lure of her blue eyes, upon the train and in hollow
Benton, surged anew now&mdash;perhaps seasoned to present
taste by my peppery defiance of Daniel. A man
could do no less than bristle a little, under the circumstances;
could do no less than challenge the torpedoes,
like Farragut in Mobile Bay. Whether the
game was worth the candle, I was not to be bullied
out of my privileges by a clown swash-buckler who
aped the characteristics of a pouter pigeon.</p>
<p>Mr. Jenks was just going to bed under the wagon.
With pretext of warming up the coffee I kicked the
fire together; while squatting and sipping I managed
to unfold the note and read it by the flicker, my back
to the camp.</p>
<p>All that it said, was:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>If you are not disgusted with me I will walk
a stretch with you on the trail, during the morning.</p>
</div>
<p>The engagement sent me to my blanket cogitating.
When a woman proposes, one never knows precisely
the reason. Anyway, I was young enough so to
fancy. For a long time I lay outside the wagons,
apart in the desert camp, gazing up at the twinkling
stars, while the wolves whimpered around, and somewhere
she slept beside the gentle Rachael, and somewhere
Daniel snored, and here I conned her face and
her words, elatedly finding them very pleasing.</p>
<p>Salt Lake was far, the Big Tent farther by perspective
if not by miles. I recognized the legal rights
of her husband, but no ruffling Daniel should quash
the undeniable rights of Yours Truly. I indeed felt
virtuous and passing valorous, with that commonplace
note in my pocket.</p>
<p>We all broke camp at sunrise. She rode for a distance
upon the seat of Daniel&#8217;s wagon&mdash;he lustily
trudging alongside. Then I marked her walking,
herself; she had shortened her skirt; and presently
lingering by the trail she dropped behind, leaving the
wagon to lumber on, with Daniel helplessly turning
head over shoulder, bereft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet you the lady up yonder is aimin&#8217; to pay you a
visit,&#8221; quoth friend Jenks the astute. &#8220;And Dan&#8217;l,
he don&#8217;t cotton to it. You ain&#8217;t great shakes with a
gun, I reckon?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had use for one,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But her
whereabouts in the train is not a matter of shooting,
is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A feller quick on the draw, like him, is alluz
wantin&#8217; to practice, to keep his hand in. Anyhow I&#8217;d
advise you to stay clear of her, else watch him mighty
sharp. He&#8217;s thinkin&#8217; of takin&#8217; a squaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>We rolled on, in the dust, while the animals
coughed and the teamsters chewed and swore. And
next, here she was, idling until our outfit drew
abreast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mornin&#8217;,&#8221; Jenks grunted, with a shortness that
bespoke his disapproval; whereupon he fell back and
left us.</p>
<p>She smiled at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you offer me a ride, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>My response was instant: a long &#8220;Whoa-oa!&#8221; in
best mule-whacker. The eight-team hauled negligent,
their mulish senses steeped in the drudgery of
the trail; only the wheel pair flopped inquiring ears.
When I hailed again, Jenks came puffing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter hyar?&#8221; He ran rapid eye
over wagon and animals and saw nothing amiss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Montoyo wishes to ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The hell, man!&#8221; He snatched whip and
launched it, up the faltering team. The cracker
popped an inch above the off lead mule&#8217;s cringing
haunch twenty feet before. &#8220;You can&#8217;t stop hyar!
Can&#8217;t hold the rest of the train. Joe! Baldy! Hep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
with you!&#8221; The team straightened out; he restored
me the whip. His wrath subsided, for in less dudgeon
he addressed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to ride, do ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, in Gawd&#8217;s name ride, then. But we don&#8217;t
stop for passengers.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, in another white heat he had picked her
up bodily, swung her upon the nearest mule; so that
before she knew (she scarce had time to utter an
astonished little ejaculation as she yielded to his
arms) there she was, perched, breathless, upon the
sweaty hide. I awaited results.</p>
<p>Jenks chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you need is an old feller, lady. These
young bucks ain&#8217;t broke to the feed canvas. Now
when you want to get off you call me. You don&#8217;t
weigh more&#8217;n a peck of beans.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a bantering wink at me he again fell back.
Once more I had been forestalled. There should be
no third time.</p>
<p>My Lady sat clinging, at first angry-eyed, but in a
moment softened by my discomfiture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your partner is rather sudden,&#8221; she averred.
&#8220;He asked permission of neither me nor the
mule.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He meant well. He isn&#8217;t used to women,&#8221; I
apologized.</p>
<p>&#8220;More used to mules, I judge.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. If he had asked the mule it would have
objected, whereas it&#8217;s delighted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he knows there&#8217;s not much difference between
a woman and a mule, in that respect,&#8221; she
proffered. &#8220;You need not apologize for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I apologize for myself,&#8221; I blurted. &#8220;I see I&#8217;m a
little slow for this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; She soberly surveyed me as I ploughed
through the dust, at her knees. &#8220;I think you&#8217;ll catch
up. If you don&#8217;t object to my company, yourself,
occasionally, maybe I can help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly cannot object to your company whenever
it is available, madam,&#8221; I assured.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not hold your experience in Benton
against me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got no more than I deserved, in the Big Tent,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;I went in as a fool and I came out as a fool,
but considerably wiser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You reproached me for it,&#8221; she accused. &#8220;You
hated me. Do you hate me still, I wonder? I tell
you I was not to blame for the loss of your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The money has mattered little, madam,&#8221; I informed.
&#8220;It was only a few dollars, and it turned
me to a job more to my liking and good health than
fiddling my time away, back there. I have you to
thank for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! You are cruel, sir. You thank me for
the good and you saddle me with the bad. I accept
neither. Both, as happened, were misplays. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
should not have lost money, you should not have
changed vocation. You should have won a little
money and you should have pursued health in Benton.&#8221;
She sighed. &#8220;And we all would have been
reasonably content. Now here you and I are&mdash;and
what are we going to do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; I echoed, annoyingly haphazard. &#8220;Why
so? You&#8217;re being well cared for, I take it; and I&#8217;m
under engagement for Salt Lake myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer did sound rude. I was still a cad. She
eyed me, with a certain whiteness, a certain puzzled
intentness, a certain fugitive wistfulness&mdash;a mute estimation
that made me too conscious of her clear
appraising gaze and rack my brain for some disarming
remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not responsible for me, you would say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at your service,&#8221; I corrected. The platitude
was the best that I could muster to my tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is something,&#8221; she mused. &#8220;Once you were
not that&mdash;when I proposed a partnership. You are
afraid of me?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I be?&#8221; I parried. But I was beginning;
or continuing. I had that curious inward
quiver, not unpleasant, anticipatory of possible
events.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a cautious Yankee. You answer one
question with another.&#8221; She laughed lightly. &#8220;Yes,
why should you be? I cannot run away with you;
not when Daniel and your Mr. Jenks are watching us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
so closely. And you have no desire to be run away
with. And Pedro must be considered. Altogether,
you are well protected, even if your conscience slips.
But tell me: Do you blame me for running away
from Montoyo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; I heartily assured.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would have helped me, at the last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I should have felt fully warranted.&#8221;
Again I floundered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even to stowing me with a bull train?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anywhere, madam, for your betterment, to free
you from that brute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She clapped her hands. &#8220;But you didn&#8217;t
have to. I only embarrassed you by appearing on
my own account. You have some spirit, though.
You came to the Adams circle, last night. You did
your duty. I expected you. But you must not do it
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are objections, there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From Hyrum?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From that Daniel, then. Well, I will come to
Captain Adams&#8217; camp as often as I like, if with the
Captain&#8217;s permission. And I shall come to see you,
whether with his permission or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;I&mdash;you would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
have helped me once, you say? And once you refused
me. Would you help me next time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as I could,&#8221; said I&mdash;another of those
damned hedging responses that for the life of me I
could not manipulate properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Of course! The queen deceived
you; now you are wise. You are afraid. But
so am I. Horribly afraid. I have misplayed again.&#8221;
She laughed bitterly. &#8220;I am with Daniel&mdash;it is to be
Daniel and I in the Lion&#8217;s den. You know they call
Brigham Young the Lion of the Lord. I doubt if
even Rachael is angel enough.&#8221; She paused.
&#8220;They&#8217;re going to make nooning, aren&#8217;t they? I
mustn&#8217;t stay. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sprang to lift her, but with gay shake of head she
slipped off of herself and landed securely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can stand alone. I have to. Men are always
ready to do what I don&#8217;t ask them to do, as long as I
can serve as a tool or a toy. You will be very, very
careful. Good-day, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flashed just the trace of a smile; gathering her
skirt she ran on, undeterred by the teamsters applauding
her spryness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swing out!&#8221; shouted Jenks, from rear. &#8220;We&#8217;re
noonin&#8217;.&#8221; The lead wagons had halted beside the
trail and all the wagons following began to imitate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>I TAKE A LESSON</h3>
</div>

<p>From this hour&#8217;s brief camp, early made, we
should have turned southward, to leave the railroad
line and cross country for the Overland Stage trail
that skirted the southern edge of the worse desert
before us. But Captain Hyrum was of different
mind. With faith in the Lord and bull confidence in
himself he had resolved to keep straight on by the
teamster road which through league after league ever
extended fed supplies to the advance of the builders.</p>
<p>Under its adventitious guidance we should strike
the stage road at Bitter Creek, eighty or one hundred
miles; thence trundle, veering southwestward, for the
famed City of the Saints, near two hundred miles
farther.</p>
<p>Therefore after nooning at a pool of stagnant,
scummy water we hooked up and plunged ahead,
creaking and groaning and dust enveloped, constantly
outstripped by the hurrying construction
trains thundering over the newly laid rails, we ourselves
the tortoise in the race.</p>
<p>My Lady did not join me again to-day, nor on the
morrow. She abandoned me to a sense of dissatisfaction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
with myself, of foreboding, and of a void in
the landscape.</p>
<p>Our sorely laden train went swaying and pitching
across the gaunt face of a high, broad plateau, bleak,
hot, and monotonous in contour; underfoot the reddish
granite pulverized by grinding tire and hoof,
over us the pale bluish fiery sky without a cloud, distant
in the south the shining tips of a mountain
range, and distant below in the west the slowly
spreading vista of a great, bared ocean-bed, simmering
bizarre with reds, yellows and deceptive whites,
and ringed about by battlements jagged and rock
hewn.</p>
<p>Into this enchanted realm we were bound; by token
of the smoke blotches the railroad line led thither.
The teamsters viewed the unfolding expanse phlegmatically.
They called it the Red Basin. But to me,
fresh for the sight, it beckoned with fantastic issues.
Even the name breathed magic. Wizard spells hovered
there; the railroad had not broken them&mdash;the
cars and locomotives, entering, did not disturb the
brooding vastness. A man might still ride errant into
those slumberous spaces and discover for himself;
might boldly awaken the realm and rule with a princess
by his side.</p>
<p>But romance seemed to have no other sponsor in
this plodding, whip-cracking, complaining caravan.
So I lacked, woefully lacked, kindred companionship.</p>
<p>Free to say, I did miss My Lady, perched upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
stoic mule while like an Arab chief I convoyed her.
The steady miles, I admitted, were going to be as
disappointing as tepid water, when not aërated by her
counsel and piquant allusions, by her sprightly readiness
and the essential elements of her blue eyes, her
facile lips, and that bright hair which no dust could
dim.</p>
<p>After all she was distinctly feminine&mdash;bravely
feminine; and if she wished to flirt as a relief from
the cock-sure Daniel and the calm methods of her
Mormon guardians, why, let us beguile the way. I
should second with eyes open. That was accepted.</p>
<p>Moreover, something about her weighed upon me.
A consciousness of failing her, a woman, in emergency,
stung my self-respect. She had twitted me with
being &#8220;afraid&#8221;; afraid of her, she probably meant.
That I could pass warily. But she had said that she,
too, was afraid: &#8220;horribly afraid,&#8221; and an honest
shudder had attended upon the words as if a real
danger hedged. She had an intuition. The settled
convictions of my Gentile friends coincided. &#8220;With
Daniel in the Lion&#8217;s den&#8221;&mdash;that phrase repeated itself
persistent. She had uttered it in a fear accentuated
by a mirthless laugh. Could such a left-handed
wooer prove too much for her? Well, if she was
afraid of Daniel I was not and she should not think
so.</p>
<p>I could see her now and then, on before. She
rode upon the wagon seat of her self-appointed executor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
And I might see him and his paraded impertinences.</p>
<p>Except for the blowing of the animals and the
mechanical noises of the equipment the train subsided
into a dogged patience, while parched by the dust and
the thin dry air and mocked by the speeding construction
crews upon the iron rails it lurched westward at
two and a half miles an hour, for long hours outfaced
by the blinding sun.</p>
<p>Near the western edge of the plateau we made an
evening corral. After supper the sound of revolver
shots burst flatly from a mess beyond us, and startled.
Everything was possible, here in this lone horizon-land
where rough men, chafed by a hard day, were
gathered suddenly relaxed and idle. But the shots
were accompanied by laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re only tryin&#8217; to spile a can,&#8221; Jenks reassured.
&#8220;By golly, we&#8217;ll go over and l&#8217;arn &#8217;em a lesson.&#8221;
He glanced at me. &#8220;Time you loosened up
that weepon o&#8217; yourn, anyhow. Purty soon it&#8217;ll stick
fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>I arose with him, glad of any diversion. The circle
had not yet formed at Hyrum&#8217;s fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me as a useless piece of baggage,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;I bought it in Benton but I haven&#8217;t needed it.
I can kill a rattlesnake easier with my whip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;down in yonder you&#8217;re liable
to meet up with a rattler too smart for your whip,
account of his freckles. &#8217;Twon&#8217;t do you no harm to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
spend a few ca&#8217;tridges, so you&#8217;ll be ready for business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men were banging, by turn, at a sardine can
set up on the sand about twenty paces out. Their
shadows stretched slantwise before them, grotesquely
lengthened by the last efforts of the disappearing sun.
Some aimed carefully from under pulled-down hat
brims; others, their brims flared back, fired quickly,
the instant the gun came to the level. The heavy
balls sent the loose soil flying in thick jets made golden
by the evening glow. But amidst the furrows the can
sat untouched by the plunging missiles.</p>
<p>We were greeted with hearty banter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyar&#8217;s the champeens!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now they&#8217;ll show us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t never see that pilgrim unlimber his gun yit,
but I reckon he&#8217;s a bad &#8217;un.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jenks, old hoss, cain&#8217;t you l&#8217;an that durned can
manners?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to oblige you, boys,&#8221; friend Jenks smiled.
&#8220;What you thinkin&#8217; to do: hit that can or plant a
lead mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give him room. He&#8217;s made his brag,&#8221; they cried.
&#8220;And if he don&#8217;t plug it that pilgrim sure will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Jenks drew and took his stand; banged with
small preparation and missed by six inches&mdash;a fact
that brought him up wide awake, so to speak, badgered
by derision renewed. A person needs must have
a bull hide, to travel with a bull train, I saw.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gimme another, boys, and I&#8217;ll hit it in the nose,&#8221;
he growled sheepishly; but they shoved him aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no. Pilgrim&#8217;s turn. Fetch on yore shootin&#8217;-iron,
young feller. Thar&#8217;s yore turkey. Show us
why you&#8217;re packin&#8217; all that hardware.&#8221;</p>
<p>Willy-nilly I had to demonstrate my greenness; so
in all good nature I drew, and stood, and cocked, and
aimed. The Colt&#8217;s exploded with prodigious blast
and wrench&mdash;jerking, in fact, almost above head;
and where the bullet went I did not see, nor, I
judged, did anybody else.</p>
<p>&#8220;He missed the &#8217;arth!&#8221; they clamored.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I reckon he hit Montany &#8217;bout the middle.
That&#8217;s whar he scored center!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot! Shoot!&#8221; they begged. &#8220;Go ahead.
Mebbe you&#8217;ll kill an Injun unbeknownst. They&#8217;s a
pack o&#8217; Sioux jest out o&#8217; sight behind them hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I did shoot, vexed; and I struck the ground,
this time, some fifty yards beyond the can. Jenks
stepped from amidst the riotous laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold down on it, hold down, lad,&#8221; he urged.
&#8220;To hit him in the heart aim at his feet. Here!
Like this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and taking my revolver he threw it
forward, fired, the can plinked and somersaulted,
lashed into action too late.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Gawd,&#8221; he proclaimed, &#8220;when I move like it
had a gun in its fist I can snap it. But when I think
on it as a can I lack guts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remark was pat. I had seen several of the men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
snip the head from a rattlesnake with a single offhand
shot&mdash;yes, they all carried their weapons easily
and wontedly. But the target of an immobile can
lacked in stimulation to concord of nerve and eye.</p>
<p>Now I shot again, holding lower and more firmly,
out of mere guesswork, and landed appreciably
closer although still within the zone of ridicule. And
somebody else shot, and somebody else, and another,
until we all were whooping and laughing and jesting,
and the jets flew as if from the balls of a mitrailleuse,
and the can rocked and gyrated, spurring us to haste
as it constantly changed the range. Presently it was
merely a twist of ragged tin. Then in the little silence,
as we paused, a voice spoke irritatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;laow yu fellers ain&#8217;t no great shucks at
throwin&#8217; lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel stood by, with arms akimbo, his booted legs
braggartly straddled and his freckled face primed
with an intolerant grin at our recent efforts. My
Lady had come over with him. Raw-boned, angular,
cloddish but as strong as a mule, he towered over her
in a maddening atmosphere of proprietorship.</p>
<p>She smiled at me&mdash;at all of us: at me, swiftly; at
them, frankly. And I knew that she was still afraid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon we don&#8217;t ask no advice, friend,&#8221; they answered.
Again a constraint enfolded, fastened upon
us by an unbidden guest. &#8220;Like as not you can do
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel laughed boisterously, his mouth widely open.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do wuss. I seen yu poppin&#8217; at that can.
Hadn&#8217;t but one hole in it till yu all turned loose an&#8217;
didn&#8217;t give it no chance. Haw haw! I &#8217;laow for a
short bit I&#8217;d stand out in front o&#8217; that greenie from
the States an&#8217; let him empty two guns at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S&#8217;pose you do it,&#8221; friend Jenks promptly challenged.
&#8220;By thunder, I&#8217;ll hire ye with the ten cents,
and give him four bits if he hits you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t draw on me, nohaow,&#8221; scoffed Daniel.
&#8220;I daren&#8217;t shoot for money, but I&#8217;ll shoot for
fun. Anybody want to shoot ag&#8217;in me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasted powder enough,&#8221; they grumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever see me shoot?&#8221; He was eager. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show
ye somethin&#8217;. I don&#8217;t take back seat for ary man.
Yu set me up a can. That thar one wouldn&#8217;t jump to
a bullet.&#8221;</p>
<p>In sullen obedience a can was produced.</p>
<p>&#8220;How fur?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fur as yu like.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was tossed contemptuously out; and watching it,
to catch its last roll, I heard Daniel gleefully yelp
&#8220;Out o&#8217; my way, yu-all!&#8221;&mdash;half saw his hand dart
down and up again, felt the jar of a shot, witnessed
the can jump like a live thing; and away it went, with
spasm after spasm, to explosion after explosion, tortured
by him into fruitless capers until with the final
ball peace came to it, and it lay dead, afar across the
twilight sand.</p>
<p>Verily, by his cries and the utter savagery and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
malevolence of his bombardment, one would have
thought that he took actual lust in fancied cruelty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;laow thar&#8217;s not another man hyar kin do that,&#8221;
he vaunted.</p>
<p>There was not, judging by the silence again ensuing.
Only&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;A can&#8217;s a different proposition from a man, as I
said afore,&#8221; Jenks coolly remarked. &#8220;A can don&#8217;t
shoot back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t &#8217;laow any man&#8217;s goin&#8217; to, neither.&#8221; Daniel
reloaded his smoking revolver, bolstered it with a
flip; faced me in turning away. &#8220;That&#8217;s somethin&#8217;
for yu to l&#8217;arn on, ag&#8217;in next time, young feller,&#8221; he
vouchsafed.</p>
<p>If he would have eyed me down he did not succeed.
His gaze shifted and he passed on, swaggering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Edna,&#8221; he bade. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be goin&#8217;
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>A devil&mdash;or was it he himself?&mdash;twitted me, incited
me, and in a moment, with a gush of assertion, there I
was, saying to her, my hat doffed:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll walk over with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; she responded readily. &#8220;We&#8217;re to have
more singing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men stared, they nudged one another, grinned.
Daniel whirled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;laow yu ain&#8217;t been invited, Mister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mrs. Montoyo consents, that&#8217;s enough,&#8221; I informed,
striving to keep steady. &#8220;I&#8217;m not walking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
with you, sir; I am walking with her. The only
ground you control is just in front of your own
wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yu&#8217;ve been told once thar ain&#8217;t no &#8216;Mrs. Montoyo,&#8217;&#8221;
he snarled. &#8220;And whilst yu&#8217;re l&#8217;arnin&#8217; to
shoot yu&#8217;d better be l&#8217;arnin&#8217; manners. Yu comin&#8217;
with me, Edna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As fast as I can, and with Mr. Beeson also, if he
chooses,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I have my manners in mind,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By gosh, I don&#8217;t walk with ye,&#8221; he jawed. And
in a huff, like the big boy that he was, he flounced
about, vengefully striding on as though punishing her
for a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>She dropped the grinning group a little curtsy. A
demure sparkle was in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The entertainment is concluded, gentlemen. I
wish you good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet underneath her raillery and self-possession
there lay an appeal, the stronger because subtle and
unvoiced. It seemed to me every man must appreciate
that as a woman she invoked protection by him
against an impending something, of which she had
given him a glimpse.</p>
<p>So we left them somewhat subdued, gazing after
us, their rugged faces sobered reflectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we stroll?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; I agreed.</p>
<p>Daniel was angrily shouldering for the Mormon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
wagons, his indignant figure black against the western
glow. She laughed lightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not afraid, after all, I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not of him, madam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m more afraid for you,&#8221; I confessed.
&#8220;That clown is getting insufferable. He sets out to
bully you. Damn him,&#8221; I flashed, with pardonable
flame, &#8220;and he ruffles at me on every occasion. In
fact, he seems to seek occasion. Witness this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Witness this evening,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid, too. Yes,&#8221; she breathed, confronted by a portent,
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid. I never have been afraid before.
I didn&#8217;t fear Montoyo. I&#8217;ve always been able to take
care of myself. But now, here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have your revolver?&#8221; I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t. It&#8217;s gone. Mormon women don&#8217;t
carry revolvers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They took it from you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not a Mormon woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221; She caught quick breath. &#8220;God forbid.
And sometimes I fear God willing. For I do
fear. You can&#8217;t understand. Those other men do,
though, I think. Do you know,&#8221; she queried, with
sudden glance, &#8220;that Daniel means to marry me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He?&#8221; I gasped. &#8220;How so? With your&mdash;consent,
of course. But you&#8217;re not free; you have a husband.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
My gorge rose, regardless of fact. &#8220;You
scarcely expect me to congratulate you, madam. Still
he may have points.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel?&#8221; She shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;I cannot
say. Pedro did. Most men have. Oh!&#8221; she
cried, impulsively stopping short. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
learn to shoot? Won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve about decided to,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;That appears
to be the saving accomplishment of everybody
out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of everybody who stays. You must learn to
draw and to shoot, both. The drawing you will have
to practice by yourself, but I can teach you to
shoot. So can those men. Let me have your pistol,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>I passed it to her. She was all in a flutter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must grasp the handle firmly; cover it with
your whole palm, but don&#8217;t squeeze it to death; just
grip it evenly&mdash;tuck it away. And keep your elbow
down; and crook your wrist, in a drop, until your
trigger knuckle is pointing very low&mdash;at a man&#8217;s feet
if you&#8217;re aiming for his heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At his feet, for his heart?&#8221; I stammered. The
words had an ugly sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. We are speaking of shooting now,
and not at a tin can. You have to allow for the jump
of the muzzle. Unless you hold it down with your
wrist, you over shoot; and it&#8217;s the first shot that
counts. Of course, there&#8217;s a feel, a knack. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
don&#8217;t aim with your eyes. You won&#8217;t have time.
Men file off the front sight&mdash;it sometimes catches, in
the draw. And it&#8217;s useless, anyway. They fire as
they point with the finger, by the feel. You see, they
<i>know</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently you do, too, madam,&#8221; I faltered,
amazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all,&#8221; she panted. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve heard the talk;
I&#8217;ve watched&mdash;I&#8217;ve seen many things, sir, from
Omaha to Benton. Oh, I wish I could tell you more;
I wish I could help you right away. I meant, a dead-shot
with the revolver knows beforehand, in the draw,
where his bullet shall go. Some men are born to
shoot straight; some have to practice a long, long
while. I wonder which you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is pressing need in my case,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I
shall have to rely upon my friends to keep me from
being done for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; she uttered, with a touch of asperity.
&#8220;Oh, yes. Pish, sir! Friends, I am learning, have
their own hides to consider. And those gentlemen of
yours are Gentiles with goods for Salt Lake Mormons.
Are they going to throw all business to the
winds?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You yourself may appeal to his father, and to the
women, for protection if that lout annoys you,&#8221; I ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;To them?&#8221; she scoffed. &#8220;To Hyrum Adams&#8217;
outfit? Why, they&#8217;re Mormons and good Mormons,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
and why should I not be made over? I&#8217;m under their
teachings; I am Edna, already; it&#8217;s time Daniel had a
wife&mdash;or two, for replenishing Utah. Rachael calls
me &#8217;sister,&#8217; and I can&#8217;t resent it. Good at heart as she
is, even she is convinced. Why,&#8221; and she laughed
mirthlessly, &#8220;I may be sealed to Hyrum himself, if
nothing worse is in store. Then I&#8217;ll be assured of a
seat with the saints.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can depend upon me, then. I&#8217;ll protect you,
I&#8217;ll fight for you, and I&#8217;ll kill for you,&#8221; I was on the
point of roundly declaring; but didn&#8217;t. Her kind, I
remembered, had spelled ruin upon the pages of men
more experienced than I. Therefore out of that super-caution
born of Benton, I stupidly said nothing.</p>
<p>She had paused, expectant. She resumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But no matter. Here I am, and here you are.
We were speaking of shooting. This is a lesson in
shooting, not in marrying, isn&#8217;t it? As to the pressing
need, you must decide. You&#8217;ve seen and heard
enough for that. I like you, sir; I respect your spirit
and I&#8217;m sorry I led you into misadventure. Now if
I may lend you a little something to keep you from
being shot like a dog, I&#8217;ll feel as though I had wiped
out your score against me. Take your gun.&#8221; I took
it, the butt warm from her clasp. &#8220;There he is.
Cover him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, before you. Oh, anybody! Think of his
heart and cover him. I want to see you hold.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>I aimed, squinting.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! You&#8217;ll not have time to close an eye;
both eyes are none too many. And you are awkward;
you are stiff.&#8221; She readjusted my arm and
fingers. &#8220;That&#8217;s better. You see that little rock?
Hit it. Cock your weapon, first. Hold firmly, not
too long. There; I think you&#8217;re going to hit it, but
hold low, low, with the wrist. Now!&#8221;</p>
<p>I fired. The sand obscured the rock. She clapped
her hands, delighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would have killed him. No&mdash;he would have
killed you. Quick! Give it to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>And snatching the revolver she cocked, leveled and
fired instantly. The rock split into fragments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have killed him,&#8221; she murmured, gazing
tense, seeing I knew not what. Wrenching from the
vision she handed back the revolver to me. &#8220;I think
you&#8217;re going to do, sir. Only, you must learn to
draw. I can tell you but I can&#8217;t show you. The men
will. You must draw swiftly, decisively, without a
halt, and finger on trigger and thumb on hammer and
be ready to shoot when the muzzle clears the scabbard.
It&#8217;s a trick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like this?&#8221; I queried, trying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partly. But it&#8217;s not a sword you&#8217;re drawing; it&#8217;s
a gun. You may draw laughing, if you wish to dissemble
for a sudden drop; they do, when they have
iron in their heart and the bullet already on its way, in
their mind. I mustn&#8217;t stay longer. Shall we go to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
the fire now? I am cold.&#8221; She shivered. &#8220;Daniel
is waiting. And when you&#8217;ve delivered me safe you&#8217;d
better leave me, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled, looking me straight in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quién sabe? To avoid a scene, perhaps; perhaps,
to postpone. I have an idea that it is better so.
You&#8217;ve baited Daniel far enough for to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>We walked almost without speaking, to the Hyrum
Adams fire. Daniel lifted upper lip at me as we entered;
his eyes never wandered from my face. I
marked his right hand quivering stiffly; and I disregarded
him. For if I had challenged him by so much
as an overt glance he would have burst bonds.</p>
<p>Rachael&#8217;s eyes, the older woman&#8217;s eyes, the eyes of
all, men and women, curious, admonitory, hostile and
apprehensive, hot and cold together&mdash;these I felt also
amidst the dusk. I was distinctly unwelcome. Accordingly
I said a civil &#8220;Good-evening&#8221; to Hyrum
(whose response out of compressed lips was scarce
more than a grunt) and raising my hat to My Lady
turned my back upon them, for my own bailiwick.</p>
<p>The other men were waiting en route.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t kill ye, did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall,&#8221; said one, &#8220;if you can swing a rattler by
the tail, all right. But watch his haid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friend Jenks paced on with me to our fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were keepin&#8217; cases on you, and so was he.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
He saw that practice&mdash;damn, how he did crane! She
was givin&#8217; you pointers, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; she wanted amusement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll set Bonnie Bravo to thinkin&#8217;&mdash;it&#8217;ll shorely set
him to thinkin&#8217;,&#8221; Jenks chuckled, mouthing his pipe.
&#8220;She&#8217;s a smart one.&#8221; He comfortably rocked to and
fro as we sat by the fire. &#8220;Hell! Wall, if you got
to kill him you got to kill him and do it proper. For
if you don&#8217;t kill him he&#8217;ll kill you; snuff you out like
a&mdash;wall, you saw that can travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to kill him,&#8221; I pleaded. &#8220;Why
should I?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenks sat silent; and sitting silent I foresaw that
kill Daniel I must. I was being sucked into it,
irrevocably willed by him, by her, by them all. If I
did not kill him in defense of myself I should kill him
in defense of her. Yet why I had to, I wondered;
but when I had bought my ticket for Benton I had
started the sequence, to this result. Here I was. As
she had said, here I was, and here she was. I might
not kill for love&mdash;no, not that; I was going to kill for
hate. And while I never had killed a man, and in
my heart of hearts did not wish to kill a man, since I
had to kill one, named Daniel, even though he was a
bully, a braggart and an infernal over-stepper it was
pleasanter to think that I should kill him in hot blood
rather than in cold.</p>
<p>Jenks spat, and yawned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can l&#8217;arn you a few things; all the boys&#8217;ll help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
you out,&#8221; he proffered, &#8220;When you git him you&#8217;ll
have to git him quick; for if you don&#8217;t&mdash;adios. But
we&#8217;ll groom ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Could this really be I? Frank Beeson, not a fortnight
ago still living at jog-trot in dear Albany, New
York State? It was puzzling how detached and how
strong I felt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE TRAIL NARROWS</h3>
</div>

<p>Again we broke camp. We rolled down from the
plateau into that wizard basin lying all beautiful and
slumberous and spell-locked like some land of heart&#8217;s
desire. We replenished our water casks from the
tank cars, we swapped for a little feed, we occasionally
exchanged greetings with contractor outfits,
and with grading crews. In due time we passed end
o&#8217; track, where a bevy of sweated men were moiling
like mad, clanging down the rails upon the hasty ties
and ever calling for more, more. I witnessed little
General &#8220;Jack&#8221; Casement of Ohio&mdash;a small man
with full russet beard and imperative bold blue eyes&mdash;teetering
and tugging at his whiskers and rampantly
swearing while he drove the work forward. And
we left end o&#8217; track, vainly reaching out after us,
until the ring of the rails and the staccato of the
rapid sledges faded upon our ears.</p>
<p>Now we were following the long line of bare grade,
upturned reddish by the plows and scrapers and picks
and shovels; sometimes elevated, for contour, sometimes
merged with the desert itself. There the navvies
digged and delved, scarcely taking time to glance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
at us. And day by day we plodded in the interminable
clouds of desert dust raised by the supply
wagons.</p>
<p>Captain Hyrum fought shy of their camps. The
laborers were mainly Irish, trans-shipped from steerage,
dock, and Bowery, and imported from Western
mining centers; turbulent in their relaxations and
plentifully supplied with whiskey: companies, they,
not at all to the Mormon mind. Consequently we
halted apart from them&mdash;and well so, for those were
womanless camps and the daily stint bred strong appetites.</p>
<p>There were places where we made half circuit out
from the grade and abandoned it entirely. In this
way we escaped the dust, the rough talk, and the
temptations; now and again obtained a modicum of
forage in the shape of coarse weedy grasses at the
borders of sinks.</p>
<p>But it was a cruel country on men and beasts. Our
teamsters who had been through by the Overland
Trail said that the Bitter Creek desert was yet worse:
drier, barer, dustier and uglier. Nevertheless this was
our daily program:</p>
<p>To rise after a shivery night, into the crisp dawn
which once or twice glinted upon a film of ice formed
in the water buckets; to herd the stiffened animals and
place them convenient; to swallow our hot coffee and
our pork and beans, and flapjacks when the cooks
were in the humor; to hook the teams to the wagons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
and break corral, and amidst cracking of lashes stretch
out into column, then to lurch and groan onward, at
snail&#8217;s pace, through the constantly increasing day until
soon we also were wrung and parched by a relentless
heat succeeding the frosty night.</p>
<p>The sleeping beauties of the realm were ever
farther removed. In the distances they awaited, luring
with promise of magic-invested azure battlements,
languid reds and yellows like tapestry, and patches of
liquid blue and dazzling snowy white, canopied by a
soft, luxurious sky. But when we arrived, near spent,
the battlements were only isolated sandstone outcrops
inhabited by rattlesnakes, the reds and yellows were
sun-baked soil as hard, the liquid blue was poisonous,
stagnant sinks, the snow patches were soda and bitter
alkali, the luxurious sky was the same old white-hot
dome, reflecting the blazing sun upon the fuming
earth.</p>
<p>Then at sunset we made corral; against theft, when
near the grade; against Indians and pillage when out
from the grade, with the animals under herd guard.
There were fires, there was singing at the Mormon
camp, there was the heavy sleep beneath blanket and
buffalo robe, through the biting chill of a breezeless
night, the ground a welcomed bed, the stars vigilant
from horizon to horizon, the wolves stalking and bickering
like avid ghouls.</p>
<p>So we dulled to the falsity of the desert and the
drudgery of the trail; and as the grading camps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
became less frequent the men grew riper for any diversion.
That My Lady and Daniel and I were to furnish
it seemed to be generally accepted. Here were
the time-old elements: two men, one woman&mdash;elements
so constituted that in other situation they might
have brought comedy but upon such a trail must and
should pronounce for tragedy, at least for true melodrama.</p>
<p>Besides, I was expected to uphold the honor of our
Gentile mess along with my own honor. That was
demanded; ever offered in cajolery to encourage my
pistol practice. I was, in short, &#8220;elected,&#8221; by an obsession
equal to a conviction; and what with her insistently
obtruded as a bonus I never was permitted
to lose sight of the ghastly prize of skill added to
merit.</p>
<p>At first the matter had disturbed and horrified me
mightily, to the extent that I anticipated evading the
issue while preparing against it. Surely this was the
current of a prankish dream. And dreams I had&mdash;frightfully
tumultuous dreams, of red anger and redder
blood, sometimes my own blood, sometimes another&#8217;s;
dreams from which I awakened drenched in
cold nightmare sweat.</p>
<p>To be infused, even by bunkum and banter, with
the idea of killing, is a sad overthrow of sane balance.
I would not have conceived the thing possible to me a
month back. But the monotonous desert trail, the
close companying with virile, open minds, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
strict insistence upon individual rights&mdash;yes, and the
irritation of the same faces, the same figures, the same
fare, the same labor, the same scant recreations, all
worked as poison, to depress and fret and stimulate
like alternant chills and fever.</p>
<p>Practice I did, if only in friendly emulation of the
others, as a pass-the-time. I improved a little in
drawing easily and firing snap-shot. The art was
good to know, bad to depend upon. In the beginnings
it worried me as a sleight-of-hand, until I saw
that it was the established code and that Daniel himself
looked to no other.</p>
<p>In fact, he pricked me on, not so much by word as
by manner, which was worse. Since that evening
when, in the approving parlance of my friends, I had
&#8220;cut him out&#8221; by walking with her to the Adams fire,
we had exchanged scarcely a word; he ruffled about at
his end of the train and mainly in his own precincts,
and I held myself in leash at mine, with self-consciousness
most annoying to me.</p>
<p>But his manner, his manner&mdash;by swagger and covert
sneer and ostentatious triumph of alleged possession
emanating an unwearied challenge to my manhood.
My revolver practice, I might mark, moved
him to shrugs and flings; when he hulked by me he did
so with a stare and a boastful grin, but without other
response to my attempted &#8220;Howdy?&#8221;; now and again
he assiduously cleaned his gun, sitting out where I
should see even if I did not straightway look; in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
he was most faithful, with sundry flourishes babying
me by thinking to intimidate.</p>
<p>Withal he gave me never excuse of ending him or
placating him, but shifted upon me the burden of
choosing time and spot.</p>
<p>Once, indeed, we near had it. That was on an
early morning. He was driving in a yoke of oxen
that had strayed, and he stopped short in passing
where I was busied with gathering our mules.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mister, I want a word with yu,&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, out with it,&#8221; I bade; and my heart began to
thump. Possibly I paled, I know that I blinked, the
sun being in my eyes.</p>
<p>He laughed, and spat over his shoulder, from the
saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Needn&#8217;t be skeered. I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to hurt ye. I
&#8217;laow yu expected to make up to that woman, didn&#8217;t
yu, &#8217;fore this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What woman?&#8221; I encouraged; but I was wondering
if my revolver was loose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Edna. &#8217;Cause if yu did, &#8217;tain&#8217;t no use, Mister.
Why,&#8221; indulgently, &#8220;yu couldn&#8217;t marry her&mdash;yu
couldn&#8217;t marry her no more&#8217;n yu could kill me. Yu&#8217;re
a Gentile, an&#8217; yu&#8217;d be bustin&#8217; yore own laws. But
thar ain&#8217;t no Gentile laws for the Lord&#8217;s an&#8217;inted; so
I thought I&#8217;d tell yu I&#8217;m liable to marry her myself.
Yu&#8217;ve kep&#8217; away from her consider&#8217;ble; this is to tell
yu yu mought as well keep keepin&#8217; away.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t discuss Mrs. Montoyo with you, sir,&#8221; I
broke, cold, instead of hot, watching him very narrowly
(as I had been taught to do), my hand nerved
for the inevitable dart. &#8220;But I am her friend&mdash;her
friend, mind you; and if she is in danger of being imposed
upon by you, I stand ready to protect her. For
I want you to know that I&#8217;m not afraid of you, day or
night. Why, you low dog&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221; and I choked, itching
for the crisis.</p>
<p>He gawked, reddening; his right hand quivered;
and to my chagrin he slowly laughed, scanning
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I seen yu practicin&#8217;. Go ahead. I wouldn&#8217;t kill
yu <i>naow</i>. Or if yu want practice in &#8217;arnest, start to
draw.&#8221; He waited a moment, in easy insolence. I
did not draw. &#8220;Let yore dander cool. Thar&#8217;s no use
yu tryin&#8217; to buck the Mormons. I&#8217;ve warned ye.&#8221;
And he passed on, cracking his lash.</p>
<p>Suddenly I was aware that, as seemed, every eye in
the camp had been fastened upon us two. My fingers
shook while with show of nonchalance I resumed adjusting
the halters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh! Looked for a minute like you and him
was to have it out proper,&#8221; Jenks commented, matter
of fact, when I came in. &#8220;Hazin&#8217; you a bit, was he?
What&#8217;d he say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He warned me to keep away from Mrs. Montoyo.
Went so far as to lay claim to her himself, the whelp.
Boasted of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Throwed it in your face, did he? Wall, you
goin&#8217; to let him cache her away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; I said desperately, still a-tremble:
&#8220;Why do you men put that up to me? Why do you
egg me on to interfere? She&#8217;s no more to me than
she is to you. Damn it, I&#8217;ll take care of myself but
I don&#8217;t see why I should shoulder her, except that
she&#8217;s a woman and I won&#8217;t see any woman mistreated.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled his whiskers, and grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno jest how fur you&#8217;re elected. Looks like
there was something between you and her&mdash;though I
don&#8217;t say for shore. But she&#8217;s your kind; she may be
a leetle devil, but she&#8217;s your kind&mdash;been eddicated and
acts the lady. She ain&#8217;t our kind. Thunderation!
What&#8217;d we do with her? She&#8217;d be better off marryin&#8217;
Dan&#8217;l. He&#8217;d give her a home. If you hadn&#8217;t been
with this train I don&#8217;t believe she&#8217;d have follered in.
That&#8217;s the proposition. You got to fight him anyway;
he&#8217;s set out to back you down. It&#8217;s your fracas,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;He&#8217;s been ugly toward
me from the first, without reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckoned to amuse himself. He&#8217;s one o&#8217; them
fellers that think to show off by ridin&#8217; somebody they
think they can ride. The boys hate to see you lay
down to that; for you&#8217;d better call him and eat lead
or else quit the country. So you might as well give
him a full dose and take the pot.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What pot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman, o&#8217; course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, Mrs. Montoyo has nothing to do with
it, any more than any woman. It&#8217;s a matter between
him and me&mdash;he began it by jeering at me before she
appeared. I want her left out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw!&#8221; Jenks scoffed. &#8220;That can&#8217;t be did.
He&#8217;s fetched her into it. What do you aim to do,
then? Dodge her? When you&#8217;re dodgin&#8217; her you&#8217;re
dodgin&#8217; him, or so he&#8217;ll take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not dodge him, you can bet on that,&#8221; I vowed.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t seek her, nor him; but I shall not go out of
my way to avoid either of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you give him his dose, what&#8217;ll you
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that is forced upon me, nothing. It will be in
defense of my rights, won&#8217;t it? But I don&#8217;t want any
further trouble with him. I hope to God I won&#8217;t
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore,&#8221; Jenks soothed. &#8220;You&#8217;re not a killer.
All the same, you&#8217;re elected; he began it and you&#8217;ll
have to finish it. Then you&#8217;ll needs look out for
yourself and her too, for he&#8217;s made her the stakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why will I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to. The hull train thinks so, one way or
t&#8217;other, and you&#8217;re white.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She can stay with the Mormons, if she wants
to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; if she wants to. But do you reckon she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
does? Not much! She&#8217;s lookin&#8217; to you&mdash;she&#8217;s
lookin&#8217; to you. She&#8217;s a smart leetle piece&mdash;knows
how to play her cards, and she&#8217;s got you and Dan&#8217;l
goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s married. You can&#8217;t expect&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he wagged again, interrupting. &#8220;Shore.
There&#8217;s Montoyo. I don&#8217;t envy you your job, but
damn&#8217; if you mightn&#8217;t work harder and do wuss.
She&#8217;s a clipper, and I never did hear anything
&#8217;specially bad of her, beyond cappin&#8217;. Whoa,
Jinny!&#8221;</p>
<p>I wrathfully cogitated. Now I began to hate her.
I was a tool to her hand, once more, was I? And
how had it come about? She had not directly besought
me to it&mdash;not by word. Daniel had decreed,
and already our antagonism had been on. And I had
defied him&mdash;naturally. He should not bilk me of
free movement. But the issue might, on the face of
it, appear to be she. As I tugged at the harness, under
breath I cursed the scurvy turn of events; and in
seeking to place the blame found amazing cleverness
in her. Just the same, I was not going to kill him for
her account; never, never! And I wished to the deuce
that she&#8217;d kept clear of me.</p>
<p>Jenks was speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the fust chance you get you might as well walk
straight into him, call him all the names you can lay
tongue to, and when he makes a move for his gun
beat him to the draw and come up shootin&#8217;. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
it&#8217;ll be over with. The longer it hangs, the less peace
you&#8217;ll have; for you&#8217;ve got to do it sooner or later.
It&#8217;s you or him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not necessarily,&#8221; I faltered. &#8220;There may be another
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t, if you&#8217;re a he critter on two legs,&#8221;
snapped Jenks. &#8220;Not in this country or any other
white man&#8217;s country; no, nor in red man&#8217;s country
neither. What you do back in the States, can&#8217;t say.
Trust in pray&#8217;r, mebbe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless I determined to make a last effort
even at the risk of losing caste. In the reaction from
the pressure of that recent encounter when I might
have killed, but didn&#8217;t, I again had a spell of fierce,
sick protest against the rôle being foisted upon me&mdash;foisted,
I could see, by her machinations as well as by
his animosity. The position was too false to be
borne. There was no joy in it, no zest, no adequate
reward. Why, in God&#8217;s name, should I be sentenced
to have blood upon my hands and soul? Surely I
might be permitted to stay clean.</p>
<p>Therefore this evening immediately after corral
was formed I sought out Captain Adams, as master
of the train; and disregarding the gazes that followed
me and that received me I spoke frankly, here at his
own wagon, without preliminary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel and I appear to be at outs, sir,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Why, I do not know, except that he seems to have
had a dislike for me from the first day. If he&#8217;ll let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
me alone I&#8217;ll let him alone. I&#8217;m not one to look for
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>His heavy face, with those thick pursed lips and
small china blue eyes, changed not a jot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel will take care of himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is his privilege,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I am not
here to question his rights, Captain, as long as he
keeps within them; but I don&#8217;t require of him to take
care of me also. If he will hold to his own trail I&#8217;ll
hold to mine, and I assure you there&#8217;ll be no trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel will take care of himself, I say,&#8221; he reiterated.
&#8220;Yes, and look after all that belongs to him,
stranger. There&#8217;s no use threatening Daniel. What
he does he does as servant of the Lord and he fears
naught.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I, sir,&#8221; I retorted hotly. &#8220;One may
wish to avoid trouble and still not fear it. I have not
come to you with complaint. I merely wish to explain.
You are captain of the train and responsible
for its conduct. I give you notice that I shall defend
myself against insult and annoyance.&#8221;</p>
<p>I turned on my heel&mdash;sensed poised forms and inquiring
faces; and his booming voice stayed me.</p>
<p>&#8220;A moment, stranger. Your talk is big. What
have you to do with this woman Edna?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Mrs. Montoyo? What I please, if it pleases
her, sir. If she claims your protection, very good.
Should she claim mine, she&#8217;ll have it.&#8221; And there,
confound it, I had spoken. &#8220;But with this, Daniel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
has nothing to do. I believe that the lady you mention
is simply your present guest and my former acquaintance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You err,&#8221; he thundered, darkening. &#8220;You cannot
be expected to see the light. But I say to you,
keep away, keep away. I will have no gallivanting,
no cozening and smiling and prating and distracting.
She must be nothing to you. Never can be, never
shall be. Her way is appointed, the instrument
chosen, and as a sister in Zion she shall know you not.
Now get you gone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; a favorite expression of his.
&#8220;Get you gone, meddle not hereabouts, and I&#8217;ll see to
it that you are spared from harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surprising myself, and perhaps him, I gazed full at
him and laughed without reserve or irritation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Captain,&#8221; I heard myself saying. &#8220;I
am perfectly capable of self-protection. And I expect
to remain a friend of Mrs. Montoyo as long as
she permits me. For your bluster and Daniel&#8217;s I care
not a sou. In fact, I consider you a pair of damned
body-snatchers. Good-evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then out I stormed, boiling within, reckless of opposition&mdash;even
courting it; but met none, Daniel least
of all (for he was elsewhere), until as I passed on
along the lined-up wagons I heard my name uttered
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Beeson.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not My Lady; her I had not glimpsed. The
gentle English girl Rachael had intercepted me. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
stood between two wagons, whither she had hastened.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be careful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far, madam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of yourself, and for her. Oh, be careful. You
can gain nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face and tone entreated me. She was much in
earnest, the roses of her round cheeks paled, her hands
clasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall only look out for myself,&#8221; said I. &#8220;That
seems necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should keep away from our camp, and from
Daniel. There is nothing you can do. You&mdash;if you
could only understand.&#8221; Her hands tightened upon
each other. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you be careful? More careful?
For I know. You cannot interfere; there is no way.
You but run great risk. Sister Edna will be happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she send you, madam?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;N-no; yes. Yes, she wishes it. Her place has
been found. The Lord so wills. We all are happy
in Zion, under the Lord. Surely you would not try
to interfere, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no desire to interfere with the future happiness
of Mrs. Montoyo,&#8221; I stiffly answered. &#8220;She
is not the root of the business between Daniel and me,
although he would have it appear so. And you yourself,
a woman, are satisfied to have her forced into
Mormonism?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has been living in sin, sir. The truth is appointed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
only among the Latter Day Saints. We have
the book and the word&mdash;the Gentile priests are not
ordained of the Lord for laying on of hands. In
Zion Edna shall be purged and set free; there she
shall be brought to salvation. Our bishops, perhaps
Brigham Young himself, will show her the way. But
no woman in Zion is married without consent. The
Lord directs through our prophets. Oh, sir, if you
could only see!&#8221;</p>
<p>An angel could not have pleaded more sweetly. To
have argued with her would have been sacrilege, for
I verily believed that she was pure of heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing for me to say, madam,&#8221; I responded.
&#8220;As far as I can do so with self-respect I
will avoid Daniel. I certainly shall not intrude upon
your party, or bother Mrs. Montoyo. But if Daniel
brings trouble to me I will hand it back to him.
That&#8217;s flat. He shall not flout me out of face. It
rests with him whether we travel on peacefully or not.
And I thank you for your interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will pray for you,&#8221; she said simply. &#8220;Good-bye,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>She withdrew, hastening again, sleek haired, round
figured, modest in her shabby gown. I proceeded to
the outfit with a new sense of disease. If she&mdash;if
Mrs. Montoyo really had yielded, if she were out of
the game&mdash;but she never had been in it; not to me.
And still I conned the matter over and over, vainly
convincing myself that the situation had cleared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Notwithstanding all my effort, I somehow felt that an
incentive had vanished, leaving a gap. The affair
now had simmered down to plain temper and tit for
tat. I championed nothing, except myself.</p>
<p>Why, with her submissive, in a fracas I might be
working hurt to her, beyond the harm to him. But
she be hanged, as to that phase of it. I had been led
on so far that there was no solution save as Daniel
turned aside. Heaven knows that the matter would
have been sordid enough had it focused upon a gambler&#8217;s
wife; and here it looked only prosaic. Thus
viewing it I fought an odd disappointment in myself,
coupled with a keener disappointment in her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You talked to Hyrum, I see,&#8221; Jenks commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout Dan&#8217;l, mebbe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to make plain that the business is none
of my seeking. Hyrum is wagon master.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t get any satisfaction, I&#8217;ll bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. On the contrary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could have told you you&#8217;d be wastin&#8217; powder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; I informed, &#8220;Mrs. Montoyo is entirely
out of the matter. She never was in it except
as she was entitled to protection, but now she requires
no further notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is her wish. She sent me word by Rachael.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did? Wall?&#8221; He eyed me. &#8220;You swaller that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Willingly.&#8221; And I swallowed my bitterness also.</p>
<p>&#8220;Means to marry him, does she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rachael did not say as to that. Rather, she gave
me to understand that a way would be found to release
Mrs. Montoyo from Benton connections, but
that no woman in Utah is obliged to marry. Is that
true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m.&#8221; Jenks rubbed his beard. &#8220;Wall, they
do say Brigham Young is ag&#8217;in promisc&#8217;yus swappin&#8217;,
and things got to be done straight, &#8217;cordin&#8217; to the
faith. But an unjined female in the church is a powerful
lonely critter. Sticks out like a sore thumb.
They read the Bible at her plenty. Um-m,&#8221; mused
he. &#8220;I don&#8217;t put much stock in that yarn you bring
me. There&#8217;s a nigger in the wood-pile, but he ain&#8217;t
black. What you goin&#8217; to do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. It&#8217;s not my concern. Now if Daniel
will mind his affairs I&#8217;ll continue to mind mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, Zion&#8217;s a long way off yet,&#8221; quoth friend
Jenks. &#8220;I don&#8217;t look to see you or she get there&mdash;nor
Dan&#8217;l either.&#8221;</p>
<p>He being stubborn, I let him have the last word;
did not seek to develop his views. But his contentious
harping shadowed like an omen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>I DO THE DEED</h3>
</div>

<p>We had camped well beyond a last bunch of the
red-shirted graders, so that the thread of a trail
wended before, lonely, sand-obscured, leading apparently
nowhere, through this desert devoid of human
life. Line stakes of the surveyors denoted the grade;
but the surveyors&#8217; work was done, here. Rush orders
from headquarters had sent them all westward still,
to set their final stakes across other deserts and across
the mountains, clear to Ogden at the north end of the
Salt Lake itself.</p>
<p>Seemingly we had cut loose and were more than
ever a world to ourselves. The country had grown
sterile beneath ordinary, if possible; and our thoughts
and talk would have been sterile also were it not for
that one recurrent topic which kept them quick. In
these journeyings men seize upon little things and
magnify them; discuss and rediscuss a phase until
launched maybe as an empty joke it returns freighted
with tragedy.</p>
<p>However, now that once My Lady had eliminated
herself from my field I did not see but that Daniel and
I might taper off into at least an armed neutrality.
If he continued to nag me, it would be wholly of his
own free will. He had no grievance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>Then in case that I did kill him&mdash;if kill him I must
(and that eventuality hung over me like the sword of
Damocles) I should be not ashamed to tell even my
mother. In this I took what small comfort I might.</p>
<p>I had not spoken at length with Mrs. Montoyo for
several days. We had exchanged merely civil greetings.
To-day I did not see her during the march;
did not attempt to see her&mdash;did not so much as curiously
glance her way, being content to let well enough
alone, although aware that my care might be misinterpreted
as a token of fear. But as to proving the case
against me, Daniel was at liberty to experiment with
the status in quo.</p>
<p>Toward evening we climbed a second wide, flat
divide. We were leaving the Red Basin, they said,
and about to cross into the Bitter Creek Plains, which,
according to the talk, were &#8220;a damned sight wuss!&#8221;
Somewhere in the Bitter Creek Plains our course met
the course of the Overland Stage road, trending up
from the south for the passage of the Green River at
the farther edge of the Plains.</p>
<p>I had only faint hope that Mrs. Montoyo would be
delivered over to the stage there. It scarcely would
be her wish. We were destined to travel on to Salt
Lake City together&mdash;she, Daniel and I.</p>
<p>If the Red Basin had been bad and if the Bitter
Creek Plains were to be worse, assuredly this plateau
was limbo: a gray, bleak, wind-swept elevation fairly
level and extending, in elevation perceptible mainly by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
the vista, as far as eye might see, northward and
southward, separating basin from basin&mdash;one Hell, as
Jenks declared, from the other.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there was a wild grandeur in the site,
flooded all with crimson as the sun sank in the clear
western sky beyond the Plains themselves, so that our
plateau was still bathed in ruddy color when the Red
Basin upon the one hand had deepened to purple and
the white blotches of soda and alkali down in the
Plains upon the other hand gleamed evilly in a tenuous
gloaming.</p>
<p>We had corralled adjacent to another tainted pond,
of which the animals refused to drink but which furnished
a little rank forage for them and an oasis for a
half dozen ducks. A pretty picture these made, too,
as they lightly sat the open water, burnished to brass
by the sunset so that the surface shimmered iridescent,
its ripples from the floating bodies flowing molten
in all directions.</p>
<p>After supper I took the notion to go over there, in
the twilight, on idle exploration. Water of any kind
had an appeal; a solitary pond always has; the ducks
brought thoughts of home. Many a teal and widgeon
and canvasback had fallen to my double-barreled
Manton, back on the Atlantic coast&mdash;very long ago,
before I had got entangled in this confounded web of
misadventure and homicidal tendencies.</p>
<p>To the pond I went, mood subdued. It set slightly
in a cup; and when I had emerged from a little swale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
or depression that I had followed, attracted by the
laughter of children playing at the marge, whom
should I see, approaching on line diagonal, but Mrs.
Montoyo&mdash;her very hair and form&mdash;coming in likewise,
perhaps with errand similar to mine: simple inclination.</p>
<p>And that (again perhaps) was a mutual surprise,
indeed awkward to me, for we both were in plain
sight from the camp. Certainly I could not turn off,
nor turn back. Not now. It was make or break.
Hesitate I did, with involuntary action of muscles; I
thought that she momentarily hesitated; then I drove
on, defiant, and so did she. The fates were resolved
that there should be no dilly-dallying by the principals
chosen for this drama that they had staged.</p>
<p>Our obstinate paths met at the base of a small point
white with alkali, running shortly into the sedges.
Had we timed by agreement beforehand we could not
have acted with more precision. So here we halted,
in narrow quarters, either willing but unable to yield
to the other.</p>
<p>She smiled. I thought that she looked thinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;An unexpected pleasure, Mr. Beeson. At least,
for me. It has been some days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it has,&#8221; I granted. &#8220;Shall I pass
on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have turned aside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; I reminded, &#8220;might you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t care to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Neither did I, madam. The pond is free to all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was conscious that a hush seemed to have gripped
the whole camp, so that even the animals had ceased
bawling. The children near us stared, eyes and
mouths open.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have kept away from me purposely?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;I do not blame your discretion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not courting trouble. And as long as you
are contented yonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I contented?&#8221; She drew up, paling. &#8220;Why do
you say that, when you must know.&#8221; She laughed
weakly. &#8220;I am still for the Lion&#8217;s den.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have become more reconciled&mdash;I&#8217;ve been requested
not to interfere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You? Without doubt. By Daniel, by Captain
Adams, likely by others. More than requested, I
fancy. And you do perfectly right to avoid trouble
if possible. In fact, you can leave me now and continue
your walk, sir, with no reproaches. Believe me,
I shall not drag you farther into my affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel and Captain Adams have no weight with
me, madam,&#8221; I stammered. &#8220;But when you yourself
requested&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was merely for the time being. I asked you
to leave me at the fire because I felt sure that Daniel
would kill you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But yesterday evening&mdash;I refer to yesterday,&#8221; I
corrected. &#8220;You sent me word, following my talk
with Hyrum.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I did not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not by Rachael?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I so understood. I thought that she intimated as
much. She said that you were to be happy; were already
content. And that I would only be making
you trouble if I continued our acquaintance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Rachael.&#8221; She smiled with sudden softness.
&#8220;Rachael cannot understand, either. I&#8217;m sure
she intended well, poor soul. Were they all like
Rachael&mdash;&mdash; But I had no knowledge of her talk
with you. Anyway, please leave me if you feel disposed.
Whether I marry Daniel or not should be no
concern of yours. I shall have to find my own trail
out. Look! There go the ducks. I came down to
watch them. Now neither of us has any excuse for
staying. Good&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The hush had tightened into a strange pent stillness
like the poise of earth and sky and beast and bird just
before the breaking of a great and lowering storm.
The quick clatter of the ducks&#8217; wings somehow
alarmed me&mdash;the staring of the children, their eyes
directed past us, sharpened my senses for a new
focus. And glancing, I witnessed Daniel nearing&mdash;striding
rapidly, straight for the point, a figure portentous
in the fading glow, bringing the storm with
him.</p>
<p>She saw, too. Her eyes widened, startled, surveying
not him, but me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Please go. At once! I&#8217;ll keep him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too late now,&#8221; I asserted, in voice not mine.
&#8220;I am here first and I&#8217;ll go when I get ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to face him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to hear what he has to say, and learn what
he intends to do. I don&#8217;t see any other way&mdash;unless
you really wish me to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cried My Lady. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to
be harmed; but oh, how I have suffered.&#8221; All her
countenance was suffused&mdash;with anger, with shame,
and even with hope. She trembled, gazing at me, and
fluctuant.</p>
<p>&#8220;So have I, madam,&#8221; said I, grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; she remarked in quiet tone, &#8220;that in a
show-down you will best him. I&#8217;m sure of it; yes, I
know it. You will play the man. You act cool.
Good! Watch him very close. He&#8217;ll give you little
grace, this time. But remember this: I&#8217;ll never,
never, never marry him. Rather than be bound to
him I&#8217;ll deal with him myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be necessary, madam,&#8221; said I&mdash;a catch
in my throat; for while I was all iciness and clamminess,
my hands cold and my tongue dry, I felt that I
was going to kill him at last. Something told me; the
sheer horror of it struck through; the inevitable
loomed grisly and near indeed.</p>
<p>A panoramic lifetime crowds the brain of a
drowning man; that same crowded my brain during
the few moments which swung in to us Daniel, scowling,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
masterful, his raw bulk and his long shambling
stride never before so insolent.</p>
<p>From New York and home and peace I traveled
clear here to desert, outlawry and blood&mdash;and thence
on through a second life as a marked man; but while
I knew very well where I should shoot him (right
through the heart), I turned over and over the one
doubtful pass: where would he shoot me? Shoot me
he would&mdash;chest, shoulder, arm, head; I could not escape,
did not hope to escape. Yet no matter where
his ball ploughed (and I poignantly felt it enter and
sear me) my final bullet would end the match. Also,
I argued my rights in the business; argued them before
my father and mother, before the camp, before
the world.</p>
<p>These thoughts which precede a certain duel to the
death are not inspiring thoughts; since then I have
learned that other men, even practiced gun-men, have
had the same trepidation to the instant of pulling
weapon.</p>
<p>Daniel charged in for us. I did not touch revolver
butt; he did not. My Lady lifted chin, to receive
him. My eyes, fastened upon him, noted her, and
noted, beyond us, the spying visages of the camp folk,
all turned our way, transfixed and agog.</p>
<p>He barked first at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go whar yu belong, yu Jezebel! Then I&#8217;ll tend
to this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The rabid epithet leveled at me I
shall not repeat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>She straightened whitely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful what you say, Daniel. No man on
this earth can speak to me like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>All his face flushed livid with a sneer, merging together
yellow freckles and tanned skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t, can&#8217;t he? I kin an&#8217; I do. Why yu&mdash;yu&mdash;yu
reckon yu kin shame me &#8217;fore that hull train? Yu
sneak out this-away, meetin&#8217; this spindle-shank, no-&#8217;count
States greenie who hain&#8217;t sense enough to
swing a bull whip an&#8217; ain&#8217;t man enough to draw a
gun? I&#8217;ve told yu an&#8217; I&#8217;m done tellin&#8217; yu. Now yu
git. I&#8217;ve stood yore fast an&#8217; loose plenty. I mean
business. Git! Whar yu&#8217;ll be safe. I&#8217;ll not hold
off much longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You threaten <i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her blue eyes were blazing above a spot of color in
either cheek&mdash;with a growl he took a step, so that she
shrank from his clutching hand, its scarred, burly fingers
outcurved. And the time, perhaps the very moment
had arrived. I must, I must.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more of that, you brute,&#8221; I uttered, while my
pounding heart flooded me with a cold, tingling
stream. &#8220;If you have anything to say, say it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He whirled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yu! Why, yu leetle piece o&#8217; nothin&#8217;&mdash;yu shut
up!&#8221; By sudden reach he gripped her arm; to her
sharp, short scream he thrust her about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git! I&#8217;m boss hyar.&#8221; And at me: &#8220;What yu
goin&#8217; to do? She&#8217;s promised to me. I&#8217;m takin&#8217; keer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
of her; she&#8217;s rode on my wagon; an&#8217; naow yu think to
toll her off? Yu meet her ag&#8217;in right under my nose
arter I&#8217;ve warned yu? Git, yoreself, or I&#8217;ll stomp on
yu like on a louse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely, hot tears of mortification, of bitter
injury, showed in his glaring eyes. He was but a big
boy, after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our meeting here was entirely by accident,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;Mrs. Montoyo had no expectation of seeing
me, nor I of seeing her. You&#8217;re making a fool of
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He burst, red, quivering, insensate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yu&#8217;re a liar! Yu&#8217;re a sneakin&#8217;, thievin&#8217; liar, like
all Gentiles. Yu&#8217;re both o&#8217; yu liars. What&#8217;s she?&#8221;
And he spoke it, raving with insult. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll tame
her. She&#8217;ll be snatched from yu an&#8217; yore kind. We&#8217;ll
settle naow. Yu&#8217;re a liar, I say. Yu gonna draw on
me? Draw, yu Gentile dog; for if I lay hands on yu
once&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; she gasped tensely. But she had
spoken late. That cold blood which had kept me in a
tremor and a wonderment, awaiting his pistol muzzle,
exploded into a seethe of heat almost blinding me. I
forgot instructions, I disregarded every movement
preliminary to the onset, I remembered only the criminations
and recriminations culminating here at last.
Bullets were too slow and easy. I did not see his revolver,
I saw but the hulk of him and the intolerable
sneer of him, and that his flesh was ready to my fingers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
And quicker than his hand I was upon him,
into him, climbing him, clinging to him, arms binding
him, legs twining around his, each ounce of me greedy
to crush him down and master him.</p>
<p>The shock drove him backward. Again My Lady
screamed shortly; the children screamed. He proved
very strong. Swelling and tugging and cursing he
broke one grip, but I was fast to him, now with guard
against his holstered gun. We swayed and staggered,
grappling hither and thither. I had his arms pinioned
once more, to bend him. He spat into my face; and
shifting, set his teeth into my shoulder so that they
champed like the teeth of a horse, through shirt and
hide to the flesh. I raised him; his boots hammered
at my shins, his knee struck me in the stomach and for
an instant I sickened. Now I tripped him; we toppled
together, came to the ground with a thump.
Here we churned, while he flung me and still I stuck.
The acrid dust of the alkali enveloped us. Again he
spat, fetid&mdash;I sprawled upon him, smothering his
flailing arms; gave him all my weight and strength;
smelled the sweat of him, snarled into his snarling
face, close beneath mine.</p>
<p>Once he partially freed himself and buffeted me in
the mouth with his fist, but I caught him&mdash;while
struggling, tossed and upheaved, dimly saw that as
by a miracle we were surrounded by a ring of people,
men and women, their countenances pale, alarmed,
intent. Voices sounded in a dull roar.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>Presently I had him crucified: his one outstretched
arm under my knees, his other arm tethered by my
two hands, my body across his chest, while his legs
threshed vainly. I looked down into his bulging
crooked eyes, glaring back presumably into my eyes,
and might draw breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Nuf? Cry &#8216;&#8217;Nuf,&#8217;&#8221; I bade.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Nuf! Say &#8216;&#8217;Nuf,&#8217;&#8221; echoed the crowd.</p>
<p>He strained again, convulsive; and relaxed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Nuf!&#8221; he panted through bared teeth. &#8220;Lemme
up, Mister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This settles it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said &#8216;&#8217;Nuf,&#8217;&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>With quick movement I sprang clear of him, to my
feet. He lay for a moment, baleful, and slowly
scrambled up. On a sudden, as he faced me, his hand
shot downward&mdash;I heard the surge and shout of men
and women, to the stunning report of his revolver
ducked aside, felt my left arm jerk and sting&mdash;felt
my own gun explode in my hand (and how it came
there I did not know)&mdash;beheld him spin around and
collapse; an astonishing sight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE TRAIL FORKS</h3>
</div>

<p>So there I stood, amidst silence, gaping foolishly,
breathing hard, my revolver smoking in my fingers
and my enemy in a shockingly prone posture at my
feet, gradually reddening the white of the torn soil.
He was upon his face, his revolver hand outflung.
He was harmless. The moment had arrived and
passed. I was standing here alive, I had killed him.</p>
<p>Then I heard myself babbling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I killed him? I didn&#8217;t want to. I tell you,
I didn&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Figures rushed in between. Hands grasped me,
impelled me away, through a haze; voices spoke in my
ear while I feebly resisted, a warm salty taste in my
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I killed him. I didn&#8217;t want to kill him. He
made me do it. He shot first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; they said, soothing gruffly. &#8220;Shore he
did; shore you didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s all right. Come along,
come along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pick him up. He&#8217;s bad hurt, himself. See that
blood? No, &#8217;tain&#8217;t his arm, is it? He&#8217;s bleedin&#8217; internal.
Whar&#8217;s the hole? Wait! He&#8217;s busted
something.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>They would have carried me.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I cried, while their bearded faces swam.
&#8220;He said &#8216;&#8217;Nuf&#8217;&mdash;he shot me afterward. Not bad,
is it? I can walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not bad. Creased you in the arm, if that&#8217;s all.
What you spittin&#8217; blood for?&#8221;</p>
<p>As they hustled me onward I wiped my swollen
lips; the back of my hand seemed to be covered with
thin blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where he struck me, once,&#8221; I wheezed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mebbe so. But come along, come along.
We&#8217;ll tend to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The world had grown curiously darkened, so that
we moved as through an obscuring veil; and I dumbly
wondered whether this was night (had it been morning
or evening when I started for the pond?) or
whether I was dying myself. I peered and again
made out the sober, stern faces hedging me, but they
gave me no answer to my mutely anxious query.
Across a great distance we stumbled by the wagons
(the same wagons of a time agone), and halted at a
fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Set down. Fetch a blanket, somebody. Whar&#8217;s
the water? Set down till we look you over.&#8221;</p>
<p>I let them sit me down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wash your mouth out.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was done, pinkish; and a second time, clearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right.&#8221; Jenks apparently was ministering
to me. &#8220;Swaller this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>The odor of whiskey fumed into my nostrils. I
obediently swallowed, and gasped and choked. Jenks
wiped my face with a sopping cloth. Hands were
rummaging at my left arm; a bandage being wound
about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; much,&#8221; was the report. &#8220;Creased him,
is all. Lucky he dodged. It was comin&#8217; straight for
his heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Jenks again asserted.</p>
<p>Under the bidding of the liquor the faintness from
the exertion and reaction was leaving me. The slight
hemorrhage from the strain to my weak lungs had
ceased. I would live, I would live. But he&mdash;Daniel?</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I kill him?&#8221; I besought. &#8220;Not that! I
didn&#8217;t aim&mdash;I don&#8217;t know how I shot&mdash;but I had to.
Didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did. He&#8217;ll not bother you ag&#8217;in. She&#8217;s
yourn.&#8221;</p>
<p>That hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it wasn&#8217;t about her, it wasn&#8217;t over Mrs. Montoyo.
He bullied me&mdash;dared me. We were man to
man, boys. He made me fight him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, shore,&#8221; they agreed&mdash;and they were not believing.
They still linked me with a woman, whereas
she had figured only as a transient occasion.</p>
<p>Then she herself, My Lady, appeared, running in
breathless and appealing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Beeson hurt? Badly? Where is he? Let
me help.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>She knelt beside me, her hand grasped mine, she
gazed wide-eyed and imploring.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s all right, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right, I assure you,&#8221; I mumbled thickly,
and helpless as a babe to the clinging of her cold fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the other man?&#8221; they abruptly asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. He was carried away. But I
think he&#8217;s dead. I hope so&mdash;oh, I hope so. The
coward, the beast!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there,&#8221; they quieted. &#8220;That&#8217;s all over
with. What he got is his own business now. He
hankered for it and was bound to have it. You&#8217;d
best stay right hyar a spell. It&#8217;s the place for you at
present.&#8221;</p>
<p>They grouped apart, on the edge of the flickering
fire circle. The dusk had heightened apace (for
nightfall this really was), the glow and flicker barely
touched their blackly outlined forms, the murmur of
their voices sounded ominous. In the circle we two
sat, her hand upon mine, thrilling me comfortably yet
abashing me. She surveyed me unwinkingly and
grave&mdash;a triumph shining from her eyes albeit there
were seamy shadows etched into her white face. It
was as though she were welcoming me through the
outposts of hell.</p>
<p>&#8220;You killed him. I knew you would&mdash;I knew
you&#8217;d have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it, too,&#8221; I miserably faltered. &#8220;But I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
didn&#8217;t want to&mdash;I shot without thinking. I might
have waited.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Waited! How could you wait? &#8217;Twas either
you or he.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I wish it had been I,&#8221; I attempted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense,&#8221; she flashed. &#8220;We all know
you did your best to avoid it. But tell me: Do you
think I dragged you into it? Do you hate me for
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It happened when you were there. That&#8217;s
all. I&#8217;m sorry; only sorry. What&#8217;s to be done
next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be decided, of course,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
will be protected, if necessary. You acted in self-defense.
They all will swear to that and back you
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you?&#8221; I asked, arousing from this unmanly
despair which played me for a weakling. &#8220;You must
be protected also. You can&#8217;t go to that other camp,
can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed and withdrew her hand; laughed
hardly, even scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I? Above all things, don&#8217;t concern yourself
about me, please. I shall take care of myself. He
is out of the way. You have freed me of that much,
Mr. Beeson, whether intentionally or not. And you
shall be free, yourself, to act as your friends advise.
You must leave me out of your plans altogether.
Yes, I know; you killed him. Why not? But he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
wasn&#8217;t a man; he was a wild animal. And you&#8217;ll find
there are matters more serious than killing even a
man, in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You! You!&#8221; I insisted. &#8220;You shall be looked
out for. We are partners in this. He used your
name; he made that an excuse. We shall have
to make some new arrangements for you&mdash;put
you on the stage as soon as we can. And meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no partnership, and I shall require no
looking after, sir,&#8221; she interrupted. &#8220;If you are
sorry that you killed him, I am not; but you are entirely
free.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group at the edge of the fire circle dissolved.
Jenks came and seated himself upon his hams, beside
us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, how you feelin&#8217; now?&#8221; he questioned of
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m myself again,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your arm won&#8217;t trouble you. Jest a flesh wound.
There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; better than axle grease. And you,
ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly well, thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the coolest of the lot, and no mistake,&#8221; he
praised admiringly. &#8220;Wall, there&#8217;ll be no more fracas
to-night. Anyhow, the boys&#8217;ll be on guard ag&#8217;in
it; they&#8217;re out now. You two can eat and rest a bit,
whilst gettin&#8217; good and ready; and if you set out &#8217;fore
moon-up you can easy get cl&#8217;ar, with what help we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
give you. We&#8217;ll furnish mounts, grub, anything you
need. I&#8217;ll make shift without Frank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mounts!&#8221; I blurted, with a start that waked my
arm to throbbing. &#8220;&#8216;Set out,&#8217; you say? Why?
And where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anywhar. The stage road south&#8217;ard is your best
bet. You didn&#8217;t think to stay, did you? Not after
that&mdash;after you&#8217;d plugged a Mormon, the son of the
old man, besides! We reckoned you two had it arranged,
by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Never!&#8221; I protested. &#8220;You&#8217;re crazy, man.
I&#8217;ve never dreamed of any such thing; nor Mrs. Montoyo,
either. You mean that I&mdash;we&mdash;should run
away? I&#8217;ll not leave the train and neither shall she,
until the proper time. Or do I understand that you
disown us; turn your backs upon us; deliver us
over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; Jenks bade. &#8220;You&#8217;re barkin&#8217; up the
wrong tree. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t a question of disownin&#8217; you.
Hell, we&#8217;d fight for you and proud to do it, for you&#8217;re
white. But I tell you, you&#8217;ve killed one o&#8217; that party
ahead, you&#8217;ve killed the wagon boss&#8217;s son; and Hyrum,
he&#8217;s consider&#8217;ble of a man himself. He stands
well up, in the church. But lettin&#8217; that alone, he&#8217;s
captain of this train, he&#8217;s got a dozen and more men
back of him; and when he comes in the mornin&#8217; demandin&#8217;
of you for trial by his Mormons, what can
we do? Might fight him off; yes. Not forever,
though. He&#8217;s nearest to the water, sech as it is, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
our casks are half empty, critters dry. We sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
surrender you; if we break with him we break ourselves
and likely lose our scalps into the bargain.
Why, we hadn&#8217;t any idee but that you and her were
all primed to light out, with our help. For if you
stay you won&#8217;t be safe anywhere betwixt here and
Salt Lake; and over in Utah they&#8217;ll vigilant you,
shore as kingdom. As for you, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he bluntly
addressed, &#8220;we&#8217;d protect you to the best of ability,
o&#8217; course; but you can see for yourself that Hyrum
won&#8217;t feel none too kindly toward you, and that if
you&#8217;ll pull out along with Beeson as soon as convenient
you&#8217;ll avoid a heap of unpleasantness. We&#8217;ll
take the chance on sneakin&#8217; you both away, and facin&#8217;
the old man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Beeson should go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I
shall return to the Adams camp. I am not afraid,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut!&#8221; he rapped. &#8220;I know you&#8217;re not
afraid; nevertheless we won&#8217;t let you do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t lay hands on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um-m,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;Mebbe not. No, reckon
they wouldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll say that much. But by thunder
they&#8217;d make you wish they did. They&#8217;d claim you
trapped Dan&#8217;l. You&#8217;d suffer for that, and in place
of this boy, and a-plenty. Better foller your new
man, lady, and let him stow you in safety. Better go
back to Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never to Benton,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;And he&#8217;s not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
my &#8217;new man.&#8217; I apologize to him for that, from
you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you stay, I stay, then,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But I think
we&#8217;d best go. It&#8217;s the only way.&#8221; And it was. We
were twain in menace to the outfit and to each other
but inseparable. We were yoked. The fact appalled.
It gripped me coldly. I seemed to have bargained
for her with word and fist and bullet, and won her;
now I should appear to carry her off as my booty: a
wife and a gambler&#8217;s wife. Yet such must be.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall go without me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a little sob she buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t hate me now you soon will,&#8221; she
uttered. &#8220;The cards don&#8217;t fall right&mdash;they don&#8217;t,
they don&#8217;t. They&#8217;ve been against me from the first.
I&#8217;m always forcing the play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon I knew that go together we should, or
I was no man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw, pshaw,&#8221; Jenks soothed. &#8220;Matters ain&#8217;t
so bad. We&#8217;ll fix ye out and cover your trail.
Moon&#8217;ll be up in a couple o&#8217; hours. I&#8217;d advise you
to take an hour&#8217;s start of it, so as to get away easier.
If you travel straight south&#8217;ard you&#8217;ll strike the stage
road sometime in the mornin&#8217;. When you reach a
station you&#8217;ll have ch&#8217;ice either way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have money,&#8221; she said; and sat erect.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>VOICES IN THE VOID</h3>
</div>

<p>The directions had been plain. With the North
Star and the moon as our guides we scarcely could
fail to strike the stage road where it bore off from
the mountains northward into the desert.</p>
<p>For the first half mile we rode without a word
from either of us to violate the truce that swathed us
like the night. What her thoughts were I might not
know, but they sat heavy upon her, closing her throat
with the torture of vain self-reproach. That much I
sensed. But I could not reassure her; could not volunteer
to her that I welcomed her company, that she
was blameless, that I had only defended my honor,
that affairs would have reduced to pistol work without
impulse from her&mdash;that, in short, the responsibility
had been wholly Daniel&#8217;s. My own thoughts
were so grievous as to crush me with aching woe that
forebade civil utterance.</p>
<p>This, then, was I: somebody who had just killed
a man, had broken from the open trail and was riding,
he knew not where, through darkness worse than
night, himself an outlaw with an outlawed woman&mdash;at
the best a chance woman, an adventuring woman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
and as everybody could know, a claimed woman,
product of dance hall and gaming resort, wife of a
half-breed gambler, and now spoil of fist and revolver.</p>
<p>But that which burned me almost to madness, like
hot lava underneath the deadening crust, was the
thought that I had done a deed and a defensible deed,
and was fleeing from it the same as a criminal. Such
a contingency never had occurred to me or I might
have taken a different course, still with decency; although
what course I could not figure.</p>
<p>We rode, our mules picking their way, occasionally
stumbling on rocks and shrubs. At last she spoke in
low, even tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you expect to do with me, please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have to do whatever is best for yourself,&#8221;
I managed to answer. &#8220;That will be determined
when we reach the stage line, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. Once at the stage line and I shall
contrive. You must have no thought of me. I understand
very well that we should not travel far in
company&mdash;and you may not wish to go in my direction.
You have plans of your own?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of any great moment. Everything has
failed me, to date. There is only the one place left:
New York State, where I came from. I probably can
work my way back&mdash;at least, until I can recoup by
telegraph message and the mails.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have one more place than I,&#8221; she replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
She hesitated. &#8220;Will you let me lend you some
money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been paid my wages due,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But,&#8221; I
added, &#8220;you have a place, you have a home: Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Benton!&#8221; She laughed under breath.
&#8220;Never Benton. I shall make shift without Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will tell me, though?&#8221; I urged. &#8220;I must
have your address, to know that you reach safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are strictly business. I believe that I accused
you before of being a Yankee.&#8221; And I read
sarcasm in her words.</p>
<p>Her voice had a quality of definite estimation
which nettled, humbled, and isolated me, as if I lacked
in some essential to a standard set.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are going home, are you?&#8221; she resumed.
&#8220;With the clothes on your back, or will you stop at
Benton for your trunk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With the clothes on my back,&#8221; I asserted bitterly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve no desire to see Benton. The trunk can be
shipped to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said on, in her cool impersonal tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the easiest way. You will live warm and
comfortably. You will need to wear no belt weapon.
The police will protect you. If a man injures you,
you can summon him at law and wash your hands of
him. Instead of staking on your luck among new
people, you can enter into business among your
friends and win from them. You can marry the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
next door&mdash;or even take the chance of the one across
the street, her parentage being comme il faut. You
can tell stories of your trip into the Far West; your
children will love to hear of the rough mule-whacker
trail&mdash;yes, you will have great tales but you will not
mention that you killed a man who tried to kill you
and then rode for a night with a strange woman alone
at your stirrup. Perhaps you will venture to revisit
these parts by steam train, and from the windows of
your coach point out the places where you suffered
those hardships and adventures from which you escaped
by leaving them altogether. Your course is the
safe course. By all means take it, Mr. Beeson, and
have your trunk follow you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I shall do, madam,&#8221; I retorted. &#8220;The West
and I have not agreed; and, I fear, never shall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By honest confession, it has bested you; and in
short order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In short order, since you put it that way. Only
a fool doesn&#8217;t know when to quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest fool is the one who fools himself,
in the quitting as in other matters. But you will have
no regrets&mdash;except about Daniel, possibly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever, save the regret that I ever tried
this country. I wish to God I had never seen it&mdash;I
did not conceive that I should have to take a human
life&mdash;should be forced to that&mdash;become like an outlaw
in the night, riding for refuge&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And I
choked passionately.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You deserve much sympathy,&#8221; she remarked, in
that even tone.</p>
<p>I lapsed into a turbulence of voiceless rage at myself,
at her, at Daniel&#8217;s treachery, at all the train, at
Benton, and again at this damning predicament
wherein I had landed. When I was bound to wrest
free after having done my utmost, she appeared to
be twitting me because I would not submit to farther
use by her. I certainly had the right to extricate myself
in the only way left.</p>
<p>So I conned over and over, and my heart gnawed,
and the acid of vexation boiled in my throat, and
despite the axle grease my arm nagged; while we rode
unspeaking, like some guilty pair through purgatory.</p>
<p>My lip had subsided; the pistol wound was superficial.
Under different circumstances the way would
have been full of beauty. The high desert stretched
vastly, far, far, far before, behind, on either side, the
parched gauntness of its daytime aspect assuaged
and evanescent. For the moon, now risen, although
on the wane, shed a light sufficient, whitening the
rocks and the scattered low shrubs, painting the land
with sharp black shadows, and enclosing us about
with the mystery of great softly illumined spaces
into which silent forms vanished as if tempting us
aside. Of these&mdash;rabbits, wolves, animals only to be
guessed&mdash;there were many, like potential phantoms
quickened by the touch of the moonbeams. Mule-back,
we twain towered, the sole intruders visible between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
the two elysians of glorified earth and beatific
sky.</p>
<p>The course was southward. After a time it seemed
to me that we were descending from the plateau;
craunching gradually down a flank until, in a mile or
so, we were again upon the level, cutting through another
basin formed by the dried bed of an ancient
lake whose waters had evaporated into deposits of salt
and soda.</p>
<p>At first the mules had plodded with ears pricked
forward, and with sundry snorts and stares as if they
were seeing portents in the moonshine. Eventually
their imaginings dulled, so that they now moved careless
of where or why, their heads drooped, their
minds devoted to achieving what rest they might in
the merely mechanical setting of hoof before hoof.</p>
<p>I could not but be aware of my companion. Her
hair glinted paly, for she rode bareheaded; her gown,
tightened under her as she sat astride, revealed the
lines of her boyish limbs. She was a woman, in any
guise; and I being a man, protect her I should, as far
as necessary. I found myself wishing that we could
upturn something pleasant to talk about; it was ungracious,
even wicked, to ride thus side by side
through peace and beauty, with lips closed and war
in the heart, and final parting as the main desire.</p>
<p>But her firm pose and face steadily to the fore invited
with no sign; and after covertly stealing a
glance or two at her clear unresponsive profile I still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
could manage no theme that would loosen my tongue.
Thereby let her think me a dolt. Thank Heaven,
after another twenty-four hours at most it might not
matter what she thought.</p>
<p>The drooning round of my own thoughts revolved
over and over, and the scuffing gait of the mules upon
way interminable began to numb me. Lassitude
seemed to be enfolding us both; I observed that she
rode laxly, with hand upon the horn and a weary
yielding to motion. Words might have stirred us,
but no words came. Presently I caught myself dozing
in the saddle, aroused only by the twitching of my
wounded arm. Then again I dozed, and kept dozing,
fairly dead for sleep, until speak she did, her voice
drifting as from afar but fetching me awake and
blinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better stop?&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<p>That was a curious sensation. When I stared
about, uncomprehending, my view was shut off by a
whiteness veiling the moon above and the earth below
except immediately underneath my mule&#8217;s hoofs.
She herself was a specter; the weeds that we brushed
were spectral; every sound that we made was muffled,
and in the intangible, opaquely lucent shroud which
had enveloped us like the spirit of a sea there was no
life nor movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; I propounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fog. I don&#8217;t know where we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I hadn&#8217;t noticed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said calmly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not lately. But I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any use in
riding on. We&#8217;ve lost our bearings.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was ahead; evidently had taken the lead while
I slept. That realization straightened me, shamed, in
my saddle. The fog, fleecy, not so wet as impenetrable&mdash;when
had it engulfed us?</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have we been in it?&#8221; I asked, thoroughly
vexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;An hour, maybe. We rode right into it. I
thought we might leave it, but we don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s as thick
as ever. We ought to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we ought,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>And at the moment we entered into a sudden clearing
amidst the fog enclosure: a tract of a quarter of
an acre, like a hollow center, with the white walls
held apart and the stars and moon faintly glimmering
down through the mist roof overhead.</p>
<p>She drew rein and half turned in the saddle. I
could see her face. It was dank and wan and heavy-eyed;
her hair, somewhat robbed of its sheen,
crowned with a pallid golden aureole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will this do? If we go on we&#8217;ll only be riding
into the fog again.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was conscious of the thin, apparently distant piping
of frogs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There seems to be a marsh beyond,&#8221; she uttered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;d better stop where we are,&#8221; I agreed.
&#8220;Then in the morning we can take stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the morning, surely. We may not be far
astray.&#8221; She swung off before I had awkwardly dismounted
to help her. Her limbs failed&mdash;my own
were clamped by stiffness&mdash;and she staggered and
collapsed with a little laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;Wait just a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay where you are,&#8221; I ordered, staggering
also as I hastily landed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she would have none of that; pleaded my one-handedness
and insisted upon coöperating at the
mules. We seemed to be marooned upon a small
rise of gravel and coarsely matted dried grasses. The
animals were staked out, fell to nibbling. I sought a
spot for our beds; laid down a buffalo robe for her
and placed her saddle as her pillow. She sank with a
sigh, tucking her skirt under her, and I folded the
robe over.</p>
<p>Her face gazed up at me; she extended her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very kind, sir,&#8221; she said, in a smile that
pathetically curved her lips. There, at my knees, she
looked so worn, so slight, so childish, so in need of
encouragement that all was well and that she had a
friend to serve her, that with a rush of sudden sympathy
I would&mdash;indeed I could have kissed her, upon
the forehead if not upon the lips themselves. It was
an impulse well-nigh overmastering; an impulse that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
must have dazed me so that she saw or felt, for a
tinge of pink swept into her skin; she withdrew her
hand and settled composedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night. Please sleep. In the morning we&#8217;ll
reach the stage road and your troubles will be near
the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under my own robe I lay for a long time reviewing
past and present and discussing with myself the
future. Strangely enough the present occupied me
the most; it incorporated with that future beyond the
fog, and when I put her out back she came as if she
were part and parcel of my life. There was a sense
of balance; we had been associates, fellow tenants&mdash;in
fact, she was entwined with the warp and woof of
all my memories dating far back to my entrance,
fresh and hopeful, into the new West. It rather flabbergasted
me to find myself thinking that the future
was going to be very tame; perhaps, as she had suggested,
regretful. I had not apprehended that the
end should be so drastic.</p>
<p>And whether the regrets would center upon my
slinking home defeated, or in having definitely cast
her away, puzzled me as sorely as it did to discover
that I was well content to be here, with her, in our
little clearing amidst the desert fog, listening to her
soft breathing and debating over what she might have
done had I actually kissed her to comfort her and assure
her that I was not unmindful of her really brave
spirit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>Daniel had been disposed of, Montoyo did not deserve
her; I had won her, she could inspire and guide
me if I stayed; and I saw myself staying, and I saw
myself going home, and I already regretted a host of
things, as a man will when at the forking of the trails.</p>
<p>The fog gently closed in during the night. When
I awakened we were again enshrouded by the fleece
of it, denser than when we had ridden through it, but
now whiter with the dawn. As I gazed sleepily about
I could just make out the forms of the two mules,
standing motionless and huddled; I could see her
more clearly, at shorter distance&mdash;her buffalo robe
moist with the semblance of dew that had beaded also
upon her massy hair.</p>
<p>Evidently she had not stirred all night; might be
still asleep. No; her eyes were open, and when I
stiffly shifted posture she looked across at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221; she warned, with quick shake of head. The
same warning bade me listen. In a moment I heard
voices.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>I STAKE AGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>They were indistinguishable except as vocal
sounds deadened by the impeding fog; but human
voices they certainly were. Throwing off her robe
she abruptly sat up, seeking, her features tensed with
the strain. She beckoned to me. I scuttled over, as
anxious as she. The voices might be far, they might
be near; but it was an eerie situation, as if we were
neighboring with warlocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been hearing them some little while,&#8221; she
whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Captain Adams men may be trailing us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not! Oh, I hope not,&#8221; she gasped, in sheer
agony. &#8220;If we might only know in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly the fog was shot with gold, as the sun
flashed in. In obedience to the command a slow and
stately movement began, by all the troops of mist.
The myriad elements drifted in unison, marching and
countermarching and rearranging, until presently,
while we crouched intent to fathom the secrets of
their late camp, a wondrously beautiful phenomenon
offered.</p>
<p>The great army rose for flight, lifting like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
blanket. Gradually the earth appeared in glimpses
beneath their floating array, so that whereas our plot
of higher ground was still invested, stooping low and
scanning we could see beyond us by the extent of a
narrow thinning belt capped with the heavier white.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she whispered, pointing. &#8220;Look!
There they are!&#8221;</p>
<p>Feet, legs, moving of themselves, cut off at the
knees by the fog layer, distant not more than short
rifle range: that was what had been revealed. A peculiar,
absurd spectacle of a score or two of amputated
limbs now resurrected and blindly in quest of
bodies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mormons!&#8221; I faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Leggins! Moccasins! They are Indians.
We must leave right away before they see us.&#8221;</p>
<p>With our stuff she ran, I ran, for the mules. We
worked rapidly, bridling and saddling while the fog
rose with measured steadiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry!&#8221; she bade.</p>
<p>The whole desert was a golden haze when having
packed we climbed aboard&mdash;she more spry than I, so
that she led again.</p>
<p>As we urged outward the legs, behind, had taken to
themselves thighs. But the mist briefly eddied down
upon us; our mules&#8217; hoofs made no sound appreciable,
on the scantily moistened soil; we lost the legs,
and the voices, and pressing the pace I rode beside
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; I inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as we can while the fog hangs. Then we
must hide in the first good place. If they don&#8217;t strike
our trail we&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fog lingered in patches. From patch to patch
we threaded, with many a glance over shoulder. But
time was traveling faster. I marked her searching
about nervously. Blue had already appeared above,
the sun found us again and again, and the fog remnants
went spinning and coiling, in last ghostly dance
like that of frenzied wraiths.</p>
<p>Now we came to a rough outcrop of red sandstone,
looming ruddily on our right. She quickly swerved
for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best chance. I see nothing else,&#8221; she muttered.
&#8220;We can tie the mules under cover, and wait.
We&#8217;ll surely be spied if we keep on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we risk it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. We&#8217;ve not start enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment we had gained the refuge. The
sculptured rock masses, detached one from another,
several jutting ten feet up, received us. We tied the
mules short, in a nook at the rear; and we ourselves
crawled on, farther in, until we lay snug amidst the
shadowing buttresses, with the desert vista opening
before us.</p>
<p>The fog wraiths were very few; the sun blazed
more vehemently and wiped them out, so that through
the marvelously clear air the expanse of lone, weird
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
country stood forth clean cut. No moving object
could escape notice in this watchful void. And we
had been just in time. The slight knoll had been left
not a mile to the southwest. I heard My Lady catch
breath, felt her hand find mine as we lay almost
touching. Rounding the knoll there appeared a file of
mounted figures; by their robes and blankets, their
tufted lances and gaudy shields, yes, by the very way
they sat their painted ponies, Indians unmistakably.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must have been camped near us all night.&#8221;
And she shuddered. &#8220;Now if they only don&#8217;t cross
our trail. We mustn&#8217;t move.&#8221;</p>
<p>They came on at a canter, riding bravely, glancing
right and left&mdash;a score of them headed by a scarlet-blanketed
man upon a spotted horse. So transparent
was the air, washed by the fog and vivified by the
sun, that I could decipher the color pattern of his
shield emblazonry: a checkerboard of red and black.</p>
<p>&#8220;A war party. Sioux, I think,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
they carry scalps on that first lance? They&#8217;ve been
raiding the stage line. Do you see any squaws?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I hazarded, with beating heart. &#8220;All warriors,
I should guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All warriors. But squaws would be worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>On they cantered, until their paint stripes and
daubs were hideously plain; we might note every detail
of their savage muster. They were paralleling
our outward course; indeed, seemed to be diverging
from our ambush and making more to the west. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
I had hopes that, after all, we were safe. Then her
hand clutched mine firmly. A wolf had leaped from
covert in the path of the file; loped eastward across
the desert, and instantly, with a whoop that echoed
upon us like the crack of doom, a young fellow darted
from the line in gay pursuit.</p>
<p>My Lady drew quick breath, with despairing exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is cruel, cruel! They might have ridden
past; but now&mdash;look!&#8221;</p>
<p>The stripling warrior (he appeared to be scarcely
more than a boy) hammered in chase, stringing his
bow and plucking arrow. The wolf cast eye over plunging
shoulder, and lengthened. Away they tore, while
the file slackened, to watch. Our trail of flight bore
right athwart the wolf&#8217;s projected route. There was
just the remote chance that the lad would overrun it,
in his eagerness; and for that intervening moment of
grace we stared, fascinated, hand clasping hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s found it! He&#8217;s found it!&#8221; she announced,
in a little wail.</p>
<p>In mid-career the boy had checked his pony so
shortly that the four hoofs ploughed the sand. He
wheeled on a pivot and rode back for a few yards,
scanning the ground, letting the wolf go. The stillness
that had settled while we gazed and the file of
warriors, reining, gazed, gripped and fairly hurt. I
cursed the youth. Would to God he had stayed at
home&mdash;God grant that mangy wolf died by trap or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
poison. Our one chance made the sport of an accidental
view-halloo, when all the wide desert was
open.</p>
<p>The youth had halted again, leaning from his saddle
pad. He raised, he flung up glad hand and commenced
to ride in circles, around and around and
around. The band galloped to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he has found it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now they will
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; I asked her.</p>
<p>And she answered, releasing my hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But we must wait. We can stand
them off for a while, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best, with the revolver,&#8221; I promised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;But after that&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had no reply. This contingency&mdash;we two facing
Indians&mdash;was outside my calculations.</p>
<p>The Indians had grouped; several had dismounted,
peering closely at our trail, reading it, timing it, accurately
estimating it. They had no difficulty, for
the hoof prints were hardly dried of the fog moisture.
The others sat idly, searching the horizons
with their eyes, but at confident ease. In the wide
expanse this rock fortress of ours seemed to me to
summon imperatively, challenging them. They surely
must know. Yet there they delayed, torturing us,
playing blind, emulating cat and mouse; but of course
they were reasoning and making certain.</p>
<p>Now the dismounted warriors vaulted ahorse; at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
gesture from the chief two men rode aside, farther to
the east, seeking other sign. They found none, and
to his shrill hail they returned.</p>
<p>There was another command. The company had
strung bows, stripped their rifles of the buckskin
sheaths, had dropped robe and blanket about their
loins; they spread out to right and left in close skirmish
order; they advanced three scouts, one on the
trail, one on either flank; and in a broadened front
they followed with a discipline, an earnestness, a precision
of purpose and a deadly anticipation that
drowned every fleeting hope.</p>
<p>This was unbearable: to lie here awaiting an inevitable
end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we make a break for it?&#8221; I proposed.
&#8220;Ride and fight? We might reach the train, or a
stage station. Quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>In my wild desire for action I half arose. Her
hand restrained me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be madness, Mr. Beeson. We&#8217;d stand
no show at all in the open; not on these poor mules.&#8221;
She murmured to herself. &#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re Sioux.
That&#8217;s not so bad. Were they Cheyennes&mdash;dog-soldiers&mdash;&mdash; Let
me think. I must talk with
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re coming,&#8221; I rasped. &#8220;They&#8217;re getting
in range. We&#8217;ve the gun, and twenty cartridges.
Maybe if I kill the chief&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke, positive, under breath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot! Don&#8217;t! They know we&#8217;re here&mdash;know
it perfectly well. I shall talk with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You? How? Why? Can you persuade them?
Would they let us go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can. I have a few words of Sioux;
and there&#8217;s the sign language. See,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve discovered our mules. They know we&#8217;re
only two.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scouts on either flanks had galloped outward
and onward, in swift circle, peering at our defenses.
Lying low they scoured at full speed; with mutual
whoop they crisscrossed beyond and turned back for
the main body halted two hundred yards out upon the
flat plain.</p>
<p>There was a consultation; on a sudden a great
chorus of exultant cries rang, the force scattered,
shaking fists and weapons, preparing for a tentative
charge; and ere I could stop her My Lady had sprung
upright, to mount upon a rock and all in view to hold
open hand above her head. The sunshine glinted
upon her hair; a fugitive little breeze bound her
shabby gown closer about her slim figure.</p>
<p>They had seen her instantly. Another chorus
burst, this time in astonishment; a dozen guns were
leveled, covering her and our nest while every visage
stared. But no shot belched; thank God, no shot,
with me powerless to prevent, just as I was powerless
to intercept her. The chief rode forward, at a walk,
his hand likewise lifted.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Keep down! Keep down, please,&#8221; she directed
to me, while she stood motionless. &#8220;Let me try.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief neared until we might see his every lineament&mdash;every
item of his trappings, even to the black-tipped
eagle feather erect at the part in his braids.
And he rode carelessly, fearlessly, to halt within easy
speaking distance; sat a moment, rifle across his leggined
thighs and the folds of his scarlet blanket&mdash;a
splendid man, naked from the waist up, his coppery
chest pigment-daubed, his slender arms braceleted with
metal, his eyes devouring her so covetously that I felt
the gloating thoughts behind them.</p>
<p>He called inquiringly: a greeting and a demand in
one, it sounded. She replied. And what they two
said, in word and sign, I could not know, but all the
time I held my revolver upon him, until to my relief
he abruptly wheeled his horse and cantered back to
his men, leaving me with wrist aching and heart
pounding madly.</p>
<p>She stepped lightly down; answered my querying
look.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m going, and so are you,&#8221; she
said, with a faint smile, oddly subtle&mdash;a tremulous
smile in a white face.</p>
<p>About her there was a mystery which alarmed
me; made me sit up, chilled, to eye her and accuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where? We are free, you mean? What&#8217;s the
bargain?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I go to them. You go where you choose&mdash;to the
stage road, of course. I have his promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>This brought me to my feet, rigid; more than scandalized,
for no word can express the shock.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go to them? And then where?&#8221;</p>
<p>She answered calmly, flushing a little, smiling a little,
her eyes sincere.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best way and the only way. We shall
neither of us be harmed, now. The chief will provide
for me and you yourself are free. No, no,&#8221; she
said, checking my first indignant cry. &#8220;Really I
don&#8217;t mind. The Indians are about the only persons
left to me. I&#8217;ll be safe with them.&#8221; She laughed
rather sadly, but brightened. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know but that
I prefer them to the whites. I told you I had no
place. And this saves you also, you see. I got you
into it&mdash;I&#8217;ve felt that you blamed me, almost hated
me. Things have been breaking badly for me ever
since we met again in Benton. So it&#8217;s up to me to
make good. You can go home, and I shall not be unhappy,
I think. Please believe that. The wife of a
great chief is quite a personage&mdash;he won&#8217;t inquire
into my past. But if we try to stay here you will
certainly be killed, and I shall suffer, and we shall
gain nothing. You must take my money. Please do.
Then good-bye. I told him I would come out, under
his promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>She and the rocks reeled together. That was my
eyes, giddy with a rush of blood, surging and hot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never, never, never!&#8221; I was shouting, ignoring
her hand. How she had misjudged me! What a
shame she had put upon me! I could not credit.
&#8220;You shall not&mdash;I tell you, you sha&#8217;n&#8217;t. I won&#8217;t
have it&mdash;it&#8217;s monstrous, preposterous. You sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
go, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t go. But wherever we go we&#8217;ll go together.
We&#8217;ll stand them off. Then if they can take
us, let &#8217;em. You make a coward of me&mdash;a dastard.
You&#8217;ve no right to. I&#8217;d rather die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; she chided, her hand grasping my sleeve.
&#8220;They would take me anyway&mdash;don&#8217;t you see?
After they had killed you. It would be the worse for
both of us. What can you do, with one arm, and a
revolver, and an unlucky woman? No, Mr. Beeson
(she was firm and strangely formal); the cards are
faced up. I have closed a good bargain for both of
us. When you are out, you need say nothing. Perhaps
some day I may be ransomed, should I wish to
be. But we can talk no further now. He is impatient.
The money&mdash;you will need the money, and I
shall not. Please turn your back and I&#8217;ll get at my
belt. Why,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;how well everything is
coming. You are disposed of, I am disposed
of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money!&#8221; I roared. &#8220;God in Heaven! You disposed
of? I disposed of? And my honor, madam!
What of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what of mine, Mr. Beeson?&#8221; She stamped
her foot, coloring. &#8220;Will you turn your back,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
or&mdash;&mdash;? Oh, we&#8217;ve talked too long. But the belt
you shall have. Here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She fumbled within her
gown. &#8220;And now, adios and good luck. You shall
not despise me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief was advancing accompanied by a warrior.
Behind him his men waited expectant, gathered
as an ugly blotch upon the dun desert. Her honor?
The word had double meaning. Should she sacrifice
the one honor in this crude essay to maintain the
other which she had not lost, to my now opened eyes?
I could not deliver her tender body over to that
painted swaggerer&mdash;any more than I could have delivered
it over to Daniel himself. At last I knew, I
knew. History had written me a fool, and a cad,
but it should not write me a dastard. We were together,
and together we should always be, come weal
or woe, life or death.</p>
<p>The money belt had been dropped at my feet. She
had turned&mdash;I leaped before her, thrust her to rear,
answered the hail of the pausing chief.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; I squalled. And I added for emphasis:
&#8220;You go to hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>He understood. The phrase might have been familiar
English to him. I saw him stiffen in his saddle;
he called loudly, and raised his rifle, threatening;
with a gasp&mdash;a choked &#8220;Good-bye&#8221;&mdash;she darted by
me, running on for the open and for him. She and
he filled all my landscape. In a stark blinding rage
of fear, chagrin, rancorous jealousy, I leveled revolver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
and pulled trigger, but not at her, though even
that was not beyond me in the crisis.</p>
<p>The bullet thwacked smartly; the chief uttered a
terrible cry, his rifle was tossed high, he bowed,
swayed downward, his comrade grabbed him, and
they were racing back closely side by side and she was
running back to me and the warriors were shrieking
and brandishing their weapons and bullets spatted the
rocks&mdash;all this while yet my hand shook to the recoil
of the revolver and the smoke was still wafting from
the poised muzzle.</p>
<p>What had I done? But done it was.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE QUEEN WINS</h3>
</div>

<p>She arrived breathless, distraught, instantly to
drag me down beside her, from where I stood stupidly
defiant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep out of sight,&#8221; she panted. And&mdash;&#8220;Oh,
why did you do it? Why did you? I think you
killed him&mdash;they&#8217;ll never forgive. They&#8217;ll call it
treachery. You&#8217;re lost, lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he sha&#8217;n&#8217;t have you,&#8221; I gabbled. &#8220;Let them
kill me if they can. Till then you&#8217;re mine. Mine!
Don&#8217;t you understand? I want you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; she faltered. She turned
frightened face upon me. &#8220;You should have let me
go. Nothing can save you now; not even I. You&#8217;ve
ruined the one chance you had. I wonder why. It
was my own choice&mdash;you had no hand in it, and it
was my own chance, too.&#8221; Her voice broke, her eyes
welled piteously. &#8220;But you fired on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the only answer left me,&#8221; I entreated.
&#8220;You misjudged me, you shamed me. I tell
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips slightly curled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Misjudged you? Shamed you? Was that all?
You&#8217;ve misjudged and shamed me for so long&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
A burst of savage hoots renewed interrupted.
&#8220;They&#8217;re coming!&#8221; She knelt up, to peer; I peered.
The Indians had deployed, leaving the chief lying
upon the ground, their fierce countenances glaring at
our asylum. How clear their figures were, in the
sunshine, limned against the lazy yellowish sand,
under the peaceful blue! &#8220;They&#8217;ll surround us. I
might parley for myself, but I can do nothing for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Parley, then,&#8221; I bade. &#8220;Save yourself, any way
you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew in, whitening as if I had struck her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you accuse me of having misjudged you!
I save myself&mdash;merely myself? What do you intend
to do? Fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as you are with me; and after. They&#8217;ll
never take me alive; and take you they shall not
if I can prevent it. Damn them, if they get you
I mean to make them pay for you. You&#8217;re all I
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d rather I&#8217;d stay? You need me? Could I
help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Need you!&#8221; I groaned. &#8220;I&#8217;m just finding out,
too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And help? How? Quick! Could I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By staying; by not surrendering yourself&mdash;your
honor, my honor. By saying that you&#8217;d rather stay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
with me, for life, for death, here, anywhere&mdash;after
I&#8217;ve said that I&#8217;m not deaf, blind, dumb, ungrateful.
I love you; I&#8217;d rather die for you than live without
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such a glory glowed in her haggard face and shone
from her brimming eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will fight, we will fight!&#8221; she chanted.
&#8220;Now I shall not leave you. Oh, my man! Had
you kissed me last night we would have known this
longer. We have so little time.&#8221; She turned from
my lips. &#8220;Not now. They&#8217;re coming. Fight first;
and at the end, then kiss me, please, and we&#8217;ll go together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The furious yells from that world outside vibrated
among our rocks. The Sioux all were in motion, except
the prostrate figure of the chief. Straight onward
they charged, at headlong gallop, to ride over
us like a grotesquely tinted wave, and the dull drumming
of their ponies&#8217; hoofs beat a diapason to the
shrill clamor of their voices. It was enough to cow,
but she spoke steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must fire,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Hurry! Fire once,
maybe twice, to split them. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll rush
us, yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I rose farther on my knees and fired once&mdash;and
again, pointblank at them with the heavy Colt&#8217;s.
It worked a miracle. Every mother&#8217;s son of them
fell flat upon his pony; they all swooped to right and
to left as if the bullets had cleaved them apart in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
center; and while I gaped, wondering, they swept
past at long range, half on either flank, pelting in
bullet and near-spent arrow.</p>
<p>She forced me down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Low, low,&#8221; she warned. &#8220;They&#8217;ll circle. They
hold their scalps dearly. We can only wait. That
was three. You have fifteen shots left, for them;
then, one for me, one for you. You understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;And if I&#8217;m disabled&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>She answered quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be the same. One for you, one for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The circle had been formed: a double circle, to
move in two directions, scudding ring reversed within
scudding ring, the bowmen outermost. Around and
&#8217;round and &#8217;round they galloped, yelling, gibing, taunting,
shooting so malignantly that the air was in a constant
hum and swish. The lead whined and smacked,
the shafts streaked and clattered&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sorry I shot the chief?&#8221; I asked. Amid
the confusion my blood was coursing evenly, and I
was not afraid. Of what avail was fear?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, glad,&#8221; she proclaimed. But with sudden
movement she was gone, bending low, then crawling,
then whisking from sight. Had she abandoned
me, after all? Had she&mdash;no! God be thanked, here
she came back, flushed and triumphant, a canteen in
her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mules might break,&#8221; she explained, short of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
breath. &#8220;This canteen is full. We&#8217;ll need it. The
other mule is frantic. I couldn&#8217;t touch her.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the moment I thought how wise and brave and
beautiful she was! Mine for the hour, here&mdash;and
after? Montoyo should never have her; not in life
nor in death.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must stop some of those fiends from sneaking
closer,&#8221; she counseled. &#8220;See? They&#8217;re trying us
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>More and more frequently some one of the scurrying
enemy veered sharply, tore in toward us, hanging
upon the farther side of his horse; boldly jerked erect
and shot, and with demi-volt of his mount was away,
whooping.</p>
<p>I had been desperately saving the ammunition, to
eke out this hour of mine with her. Every note from
the revolver summoned the end a little nearer. But
we had our game to play; and after all, the end was
certain. So under her prompting (she being partner,
commander, everything), when the next painted ruffian&mdash;a
burly fellow in drapery of flannel-fringed cotton
shirt, with flaunting crimson tassels on his pony&#8217;s
mane&mdash;bore down, I guessed shrewdly, arose and let
him have it.</p>
<p>She cried out, clapping her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Good!&#8221;</p>
<p>The pony was sprawling and kicking; the rider had
hurtled free, and went jumping and dodging like a
jack-rabbit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To the right! Watch!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again I needs must fire, driving the rascals aside
with the report of the Colt&#8217;s. That was five. Not
sparing my wounded arm I hastily reloaded, for by
custom of the country the hammer had rested over
an empty chamber. I filled the cylinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re killing the mules,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But we
can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two mules were snorting and plunging; their
hoofs rang against the rocks. Sioux to rear had dismounted
and were shooting carefully. There was
exultant shout&mdash;one mule had broken loose. She galloped
out, reddened, stirrups swinging, canteen
bouncing, right into the waiting line; and down she
lunged, abristle with feathered points launched into
her by sheer spiteful joy.</p>
<p>The firing was resumed. We heard the other mule
scream with note indescribable; we heard him flounder
and kick; and again the savages yelled.</p>
<p>Now they all charged recklessly from the four
sides; and I had to stand and fire, right, left, before,
behind, emptying the gun once more ere they scattered
and fled. I sensed her fingers twitching at my
belt, extracting fresh cartridges. We sank, breathing
hard. Her eyes were wide, and bluer than any deepest
summer sea; her face aflame; her hair of purest
gold&mdash;and upon her shoulder a challenging oriflamme
of scarlet, staining a rent in the faded calico.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hurt!&#8221; I blurted, aghast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not much. A scratch. Don&#8217;t mind it. And
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not touched.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Load, sir. But I think we&#8217;ll have a little space.
How many left? Nine.&#8221; She had been counting.
&#8220;Seven for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven for them,&#8221; I acknowledged. I tucked
home the loads; the six-shooter was ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let them come,&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them come,&#8221; I echoed. We looked one upon
the other, and we smiled. It was not so bad, this
place, our minds having been made up to it. In fact,
there was something sweet. Our present was assured;
we faced a future together, at least; we were
in accord.</p>
<p>The Sioux had retired, mainly to sit dismounted in
close circle, for a confab. Occasionally a young
brave, a vidette, exuberantly galloped for us, dared
us, shook hand and weapon at us, no doubt spat at us,
and gained nothing by his brag.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will they do next?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said she. &#8220;We shall see,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we lay, gazing, not speaking. The sun streamed
down, flattening the desert with his fervent beams until
the uplifts cringed low and in the horizons the
mountain peaks floated languidly upon the waves of
heat. And in all this dispassionate land, from horizon
to horizon, there were only My Lady and I, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
the beleaguering Sioux. It seemed unreal, a fantasy;
but the rocks began to smell scorched, a sudden thirst
nagged and my wounded arm pained with weariness
as if to remind that I was here, in the body. Yes, and
here she was, also, in the flesh, as much as I, for she
stirred, glanced at me, and smiled. I heard her,
saw her, felt her presence. I placed my hand over
hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I wanted to make sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of you, me&mdash;of everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There can be no doubt,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wish there
might, for your sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I thickly answered. &#8220;If you were only out
of it&mdash;if we could find some way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather be in here, with you,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I, with you, then,&#8221; I replied honestly. The
thought of water obsessed. She must have read, for
she inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you thirsty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Why don&#8217;t we drink?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? We might as well be as comfortable
as we can.&#8221; She reached for the canteen lying in a
fast dwindling strip of rock shade. We drank sparingly.
She let me dribble a few drops upon her
shoulder. Thenceforth by silent agreement we moistened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
our tongues, scrupulously turn about, wringing
the most from each brief sip as if testing the bouquet
of exquisite wine. Came a time when we regretted
this frugalness; but just now there persisted within
us, I suppose, that germ of hope which seems to be
nourished by the soul.</p>
<p>The Sioux had counciled and decided. They faced
us, in manner determined. We waited, tense and
watchful. Without even a premonitory shout a pony
bolted for us, from their huddle. He bore two riders,
naked to the sun, save for breech clouts. They
charged straight in, and at her mystified, alarmed
murmur I was holding on them as best I could, finger
crooked against trigger, coaxing it, praying for luck,
when the rear rider dropped to the ground, bounded
briefly and dived headlong, worming into a little hollow
of the sand.</p>
<p>He lay half concealed; the pony had wheeled to a
shrill, jubilant chorus; his remaining rider lashed him
in retreat, leaving the first digging lustily with hand
and knife.</p>
<p>That was the system, then: an approach by rushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t permit it,&#8221; she breathed. &#8220;We must
rout him out&mdash;we must keep them all out or they&#8217;ll
get where they can pick you off. Can you reach
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>The tawny figure, prone upon the tawny sand, was
just visible, lean and snakish, slightly oscillating as it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
worked. And I took careful aim, and fired, and saw
the spurt from the bullet.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little lower&mdash;oh, just a little lower,&#8221; she
pleaded.</p>
<p>The same courier was in leash, posted to bring another
fellow; all the Sioux were gazing, statuesque,
to analyze my marksmanship. And I fired again&mdash;&#8220;Too
low,&#8221; she muttered&mdash;and quickly, with a curse,
again.</p>
<p>She cried out joyfully. The snake had flopped
from its hollow, plunged at full length aside; had
started to crawl, writhing, dragging its hinder parts.
But with a swoop the pony arrived before we were
noting; the recruit plumped into the hollow; and
bending over in his swift circle the courier snatched
the snake from the ground; sped back with him.</p>
<p>The Sioux seized upon the moment of stress.
They cavorted, scouring hither and thither, yelling,
shooting, and once more our battered haven seethed
with the hum and hiss and rebound of lead and shaft.
That, and my eagerness, told. The fellow in the
foreground burrowed cleverly; he submerged farther
and farther, by rapid inches. I fired twice&mdash;we could
not see that I had even inconvenienced him. My
Lady clutched my revolver arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Wait!&#8221; The tone rang dismayed.</p>
<p>Trembling, blinded with heat and powder smoke,
and heart sick, I paused, to fumble and to reload the
almost emptied cylinder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t reach him,&#8221; said I. &#8220;He&#8217;s too far in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice answered gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter, dear. You&#8217;re firing too hastily.
Don&#8217;t forget. Please rest a minute, and drink. You
can bathe your eyes. It&#8217;s hard, shooting across the
hot sand. They&#8217;ll bring others. We&#8217;ve no need to
save water, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; I admitted.</p>
<p>We niggardly drank. I dabbled my burning eyes,
cleared my sight. Of the fellow in the rifle pit there
was no living token. The Sioux had ceased their
gambols. They sat steadfast, again anticipative. A
stillness, menaceful and brooding, weighted the landscape.</p>
<p>She sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pregnant truce oppressed. What was hatching
out, now? I cautiously shifted posture, to stretch and
scan; instinctively groped for the canteen, to wet my
lips again; a puff of smoke burst from the hollow, the
canteen clinked, flew from my hand and went clattering
among the rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, aghast. &#8220;But you&#8217;re not hurt?&#8221;
Then&mdash;&#8220;I saw him. He&#8217;ll come up again, in a moment.
Be ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Sioux in the background were shrieking.
They had accounted for our mules; by chance shot
they had nipped our water. Yet neither event affected
us as they seemed to think it should. Mules,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
water&mdash;these were inconsequentials in the long-run
that was due to be short, at most. We husbanded
other relief in our keeping.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as I craned, the fellow fired again; he
was a good shot, had discovered a niche in our rampart,
for the ball fanned my cheek with the wings of
a vicious wasp. On the instant I replied, snapping
quick answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you hit him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let me
try. It may change the luck. You&#8217;re tired. I&#8217;ll hold
on the spot&mdash;he&#8217;ll come up in the same place, head
and shoulders. You&#8217;ll have to tempt him. Are you
afraid, sir?&#8221; She smiled upon me as she took the
revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he kills me&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; I faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; Her face filled. &#8220;I should not be long.&#8221;</p>
<p>She adjusted the revolver to a crevice a little removed
from me&mdash;&#8220;They will be hunting you, not
me,&#8221; she said&mdash;and crouched behind it, peering earnestly
out, intent upon the hollow. And I edged
farther, and farther, as if seeking for a mark, but
with all my flesh a-prickle and my breath fast, like
any man, I assert, who forces himself to invite the
striking capabilities of a rattlesnake.</p>
<p>Abruptly it came&mdash;the strike, so venomous that it
stung my face and scalded my eyes with the spatter
of sandstone and hot lead; at the moment her Colt&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
bellowed into my ears, thunderous because even unexpected.
I could not see; I only heard an utterance
that was cheer and sob in one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got him! Are you hurt? Are you hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Hurrah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The air rocked with the shouts of the Sioux;
shouts never before so welcome in their tidings, for
they were shouts of rage and disappointment. They
flooded my eyes with vigor, wiped away the daze of
the bullet impact; the hollow leaped to the fore&mdash;upon
its low parapet a dull shade where no shade
should naturally be, and garnished with crimson.</p>
<p>He had doubled forward, reflexing to the blow.
He was dead, stone dead; his crafty spirit issued
upon the red trail of ball through his brain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God,&#8221; I rejoiced.</p>
<p>She had sunk back wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t they try again, you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last spare shot, I mean. We have only our
two left. We must save those.&#8221; She gravely surveyed
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we must save those,&#8221; I assented. The realization
broke unbelievable across a momentary hiatus;
brought me down from the false heights, to face it
with her.</p>
<p>A dizzy space had opened before me. I knew that
she moved aside. She exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the canteen, drained dry by a jagged gash
from the sharpshooter&#8217;s lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter, dear,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>The subject was not worth pursuing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have discouraged their game, again. And in
case they rush us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>This from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;In case they rush us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I repeated. &#8220;We can
wait a little, and see.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>WE WAIT THE SUMMONS</h3>
</div>

<p>The Sioux had quieted. They let the hollow alone,
tenanted as it was with death; there was for us a satisfaction
in that tribute to our defense. Quite methodically,
and with cruel show of leisure they distributed
themselves by knots, in a half-encircling
string around our asylum; they posted a sentry,
ahorse, as a lookout; and lolling upon the bare
ground in the sun glare they chatted, laughed, rested,
but never for an instant were we dismissed from their
eyes and thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will wait, too. They can afford it,&#8221; she
murmured. &#8220;It is cheaper for them than losing
lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they knew we had only the two cartridges&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t, yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they will find out too late,&#8221; I hazarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, too late. We shall have time.&#8221; Her voice
did not waver; it heartened with its vengeful, determined
mien.</p>
<p>Occasionally a warrior invoked us by brandishing
arm or weapon in surety of hate and in promise of
fancied reprisal. What fools they were! Now and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
again a warrior galloped upon the back trail; returned
gleefully, perhaps to flourish an army canteen at us.</p>
<p>&#8220;There probably is water where we heard the
frogs last night,&#8221; she remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we didn&#8217;t try to reach it, for camp,&#8221; said
I.</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said she. &#8220;We might have run
right into them. We are better here. At least, I
am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; I confirmed.</p>
<p>Strangely enough we seemed to have little to say,
now in this precious doldrums where we were becalmed,
between the distant past and the unlogged future.
We had not a particle of shade, not a trace of
coolness: the sun was high, all our rocky recess was a
furnace, fairly reverberant with the heat; the flies
(and I vaguely pondered upon how they had existed,
previously, and whence they had gathered) buzzed
briskly, attracted by the dead mule, unseen, and captiously
diverted to us also. We lay tolerably bolstered,
without much movement; and as the Sioux
were not firing upon us, we might wax careless of
their espionage.</p>
<p>Her eyes, untroubled, scarcely left my face; I
feared to let mine leave hers. Of what she was thinking
I might not know, and I did not seek to know&mdash;was
oddly yielding and content, for our decisions had
been made. And still it was unreal, impossible: we,
in this guise; the Sioux, watching; the desert, waiting;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
death hovering&mdash;a sudden death, a violent death,
the end of that which had barely begun; an end suspended
in sight like the Dionysian sword, with the
single hair already frayed by the greedy shears of
the Fate. A snap, at our own signal; then presto,
change!</p>
<p>It simply could not be true. Why, somewhere my
father and mother busied, mindless; somewhere Benton
roared, mindless; somewhere the wagon train
toiled on, mindless; the stage road missed us not, nor
wondered; the railroad graders shoveled and scraped
and picked as blithely as if the same desert did not
contain them, and us; cities throbbed, people worked
and played, and we were of as little concern to them
now as we would be a year hence.</p>
<p>Then it all pridefully resolved to this, like the
warming tune of a fine battle chant: That I was here,
with my woman, my partner woman, the much desirable
woman whom I had won; which was more than
Daniel, or Montoyo, or the Indian chief, or the wide
world of other men could boast.</p>
<p>Soon she spoke, at times, musingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did make up to you, at first,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In
Omaha, and on the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; I smiled. She was so childishly
frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that was only passing. Then in Benton I
knew you were different. I wondered what it was;
but you were different from anybody that I had met
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
before. There&#8217;s always such a moment in a woman&#8217;s
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>I soberly nodded. Nothing could be a platitude in
such a place and such an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wished to help you. Do you believe that now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you, dear heart,&#8221; I assured.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was partly because I thought you could
help me,&#8221; she said, like a confession. And she added:
&#8220;I had nothing wrong in mind. You were to be a
friend, not a lover. I had no need of lovers; no, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were silent for an interval. Again she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you care anything about my family? I suppose
not. That doesn&#8217;t matter, here. But you
wouldn&#8217;t be ashamed of them. I ran away with Montoyo.
I thought he was something else. How could
I go home after that? I tried to be true to him, we
had plenty of money, he was kind to me at first, but
he dragged me down and my father and mother don&#8217;t
know even yet. Yes, I tried to help him, too. I
stayed. It&#8217;s a life that gets into one&#8217;s blood. I
feared him terribly, in time. He was a breed, and a
devil&mdash;a gentleman devil.&#8221; She referred in the past
tense, as to some fact definitely bygone. &#8220;I had to
play fair with him, or&mdash;&mdash; And when I had done
that, hoping, why, what else could I do or where could
I go? So many people knew me.&#8221; She smiled.
&#8220;Suddenly I tied to you, sir. I seemed to feel&mdash;I
took the chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God you did,&#8221; I encouraged.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I would not have wronged myself, or you,
or him,&#8221; she eagerly pursued. &#8220;I never did wrong
him.&#8221; She flushed. &#8220;No man can convict me. You
hurt me when you refused me, dear; it told me that
you didn&#8217;t understand. Then I was desperate. I had
been shamed before you, and by you. You were going,
and not understanding, and I couldn&#8217;t let you.
So I did follow you to the wagon train. You were
my star. I wonder why. I did feel that you&#8217;d get me
out&mdash;you see, I was so madly selfish, like a drowning
person. I clutched at you; might have put you under
while climbing up, myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have climbed together,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You have
made me into a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I forced myself on you. I played you against
Daniel. I foresaw that you might have to kill him, to
rid me of him. You were my weapon. And I used
you. Do you blame me that I used you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel and I were destined to meet, just as you
and I were destined to meet,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I had to
prove myself on him. It would have happened anyway.
Had I not stood up to him you would not have
loved me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was not the price,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;Maybe
you don&#8217;t understand yet. I&#8217;m so afraid you don&#8217;t
understand,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;At the last I had resigned
you, I would have left you free, I saw how
you felt; but, oh, it happened just the same&mdash;we were
fated, and you showed that you hated me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I never hated you. I was perplexed. That was
a part of love,&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean it? You are holding nothing back?&#8221;
she asked, anxious.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am holding nothing back,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;As
you will know, I think, in time to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again we reclined, silent, at peace: a strange peace
of mind and body, to which the demonstrations by
the waiting Sioux were alien things.</p>
<p>She spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we very guilty, do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In what, dearest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In this, here. I am already married, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is another life,&#8221; I reasoned. &#8220;It is long
ago and under different law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we went back into it&mdash;if we escaped?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we should&mdash;but don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you should forget and I should return to
Benton,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have decided. I should return
to Benton, where Montoyo is, and maybe find
another way. But I should not live with him; never,
never! I should ask him to release me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I, with you,&#8221; I informed. &#8220;We should go together,
and do what was best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would? You wouldn&#8217;t be ashamed, or
afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ashamed or afraid of what?&#8221;</p>
<p>She cried out happily, and shivered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t have to. He might kill you.
Yes, I hope we don&#8217;t have to. Do you mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>I shook my head, smiling my response. There were
tears in her eyes, repaying me.</p>
<p>Our conversation became more fitful. Time sped,
I don&#8217;t know how, except that we were in a kind of
lethargy, taking no note of time and hanging fast to
this our respite from the tempestuous past.</p>
<p>Once she dreamily murmured, apropos of nothing,
yet apropos of much:</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be about the same age. I am not old,
not really very old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am twenty-five,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I thought,&#8221; she mused.</p>
<p>Then, later, in manner of having revolved this idea
also, more distinctly apropos and voiced with a certain
triumph:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we drank water when we might; aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were so wise,&#8221; I praised; and I felt sorry for
her cracked lips. It is astonishing with what swiftness,
even upon the dry desert, amid the dry air, under
the dry burning sun, thirst quickens into a consuming
fire scorching from within outward to the
skin.</p>
<p>We lapsed into that remarkable patience, playing
the game with the Sioux and steadily viewing each
other; and she asked, casually:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where will you shoot me, Frank?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>This bared the secret heart of me.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; I begged. &#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of that. It
will be bad enough at the best. How can I? I don&#8217;t
know how I can do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will, though,&#8221; she soothed. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather
have it from you. You must be brave, for yourself
and for me; and kind, and quick. I think it should
be through the temple. That&#8217;s sure. But you won&#8217;t
wait to look, will you? You&#8217;ll spare yourself
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>This made me groan, craven, and wipe my hand
across my forehead to brush away the frenzy. The
fingers came free, damp with cold sticky sweat&mdash;a
prodigy of a parchment skin which puzzled me.</p>
<p>We had not exchanged a caress, save by voice; had
not again touched each other. Sometimes I glanced
at the Sioux, but not for long; I dreaded to lose sight
of her by so much as a moment. The Sioux remained
virtually as from the beginning of their vigil.
They sat secure, drank, probably ate, with time their
ally: sat judicial and persistent, as though depending
upon the progress of a slow fuse, or upon the workings
of poison, which indeed was the case.</p>
<p>Thirst and heat tortured unceasingly. The sun had
passed the zenith&mdash;this sun of a culminating summer
throughout which he had thrived regal and lustful.
It seemed ignoble of him that he now should stoop
to torment only us, and one of us a small woman.
There was all his boundless domain for him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>But stoop he did, burning nearer and nearer. She
broke with sudden passion of hoarse appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do we wait? Why not now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to wait,&#8221; I stammered, miserable and
pitying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she whispered, submissive, &#8220;I suppose we
ought. One always does. But I am so tired. I
think,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that I will let my hair down. I
shall go with my hair down. I have a right to, at the
last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon she fell to loosening her hair and braiding
it with hurried fingers.</p>
<p>Then after a time I said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll not be much longer, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; said she, panting, her lips stiff, her
eyes bright and feverish. &#8220;They&#8217;ll rush us at sundown;
maybe before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; said I, blurring the words, for my
tongue was getting unmanageable, &#8220;they&#8217;re making
ready now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She exclaimed and struggled and sat up, and we
both gazed. Out there the Sioux, in that world of
their own, had aroused to energy. I fancied that they
had palled of the inaction. At any rate they were
upon their feet, several were upon their horses, others
mounted hastily, squad joined squad as though by
summons, and here came their outpost scout, galloping
in, his blanket streaming from one hand like a
banner of an Islam prophet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>They delayed an instant, gesticulating.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be soon,&#8221; she whispered, touching my arm.
&#8220;When they are half-way, don&#8217;t fail. I trust you.
Will you kiss me? That is only the once.&#8221;</p>
<p>I kissed her; dry cracked lips met dry cracked lips.
She laid herself down and closed her eyes, and
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And tired. I&#8217;ve
worked so hard, for only this. You mustn&#8217;t look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you must wait for me, somewhere,&#8221; I entreated.
&#8220;Just a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she sighed.</p>
<p>The Sioux charged, shrieking, hammering, lashing,
all of one purpose: that, us; she, I; my life, her body;
and quickly kneeling beside her (I was cool and firm
and collected) I felt her hand guide the revolver
barrel. But I did not look. She had forbidden, and
I kept my eyes upon them, until they were half-way,
and in exultation I pulled the trigger, my hand already
tensed to snatch and cock and deliver myself
under their very grasp. That was a sweetness.</p>
<p>The hammer clicked. There had been no jar, no
report. The hammer had only clicked, I tell you,
shocking me to the core. A missed cartridge? An
empty chamber? Which? No matter. I should
achieve for her, first; then, myself. I heard her gasp,
they were very near, how they shouted, how the bullets
and arrows spatted and hissed, and I had convulsively
cocked the gun, she had clutched it&mdash;when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
looking through them, agonized and blinded as I was&mdash;looking
through them as if they were phantasms I
sensed another sound and with sight sharpened I saw.</p>
<p>Then I wrested the revolver from her. I fired pointblank,
I fired again (the Colt&#8217;s did not fail); they
swept by, hooting, jostling; they thudded on; and rising
I screeched and waved, as bizarre, no doubt, as
any animated scarecrow.</p>
<p>It had been a trumpet note, and a cavalry guidon
and a rank of bobbing figures had come galloping,
galloping over an imperceptible swell.</p>
<p>She cried to me, from my feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t do it! You didn&#8217;t do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re saved,&#8221; I blatted. &#8220;Hurrah! We&#8217;re
saved! The soldiers are here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the trumpet pealed, lilting silvery. She tottered
up, clinging to me. She stared. She released
me, and to my gladly questing gaze her face was very
white, her eyes struggling for comprehension, like
those of one awakened from a dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go back to Benton,&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;I
shall never get away from Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>We stood mute while the blue-coats raced on with
hearty cheers and brave clank of saber and canteen.
We were sitting composedly when the lieutenant
scrambled to us, among our rocks; the troopers followed,
curiously scanning.</p>
<p>His stubbled red face, dust-smeared, queried us
keenly; so did his curt voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just in time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In time,&#8221; I croaked. &#8220;Water! For her&mdash;for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a canteen apiece. We sucked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the two from the Mormon wagon
train?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. You know?&#8221; I uttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came on as fast as we could. The Sioux are
raiding again. By God, you had a narrow squeak,
sir,&#8221; he reproved. &#8220;You were crazy to try it&mdash;you
and a woman, alone. We&#8217;ll take you along as soon
as my Pawnees get in from chasing those beggars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Distant whoops from a pursuit drifted in to us,
out of the desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Adams sent you?&#8221; I inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go back,&#8221; I agreed. &#8220;I will go back, but
there&#8217;s no need of Mrs. Montoyo. If you could see
her safely landed at a stage station, and for Benton&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll land you both. I have to report at Bridger.
The train is all right. It has an escort to Bitter
Creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can overtake it, or join it,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But the
lady goes to Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;That&#8217;s nothing to me,
of course. But you&#8217;ll do better to wait for the train
at Bridger, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;? I don&#8217;t believe I have your
name?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Beeson,&#8221; I informed, astonished.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the lady&#8217;s? Your sister? Wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Montoyo,&#8221; I informed. And I repeated,
that there should be no misunderstanding. &#8220;Mrs.
Montoyo, from Benton. No relative, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>He passed it over, as a gentleman should.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Beeson, you have business with the
train?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have business with Captain Adams, and he with
me,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;As probably you know. Since he
sent you, I shall consider myself under arrest; but I
will return of my own free will as soon as Mrs.
Montoyo is safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Under arrest? For what?&#8221; He blankly eyed
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;For killing that man, sir. Captain Adams&#8217; son.
But I was forced to it&mdash;I did it in self-defense. I
should not have left, and I am ready to face the matter
whenever possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said he, with a shrug, tossing the idea
aside. &#8220;If that&#8217;s all! I did hear something about
that, from some of my men, but nothing from
Adams. You didn&#8217;t kill him, I understand; merely
laid him out. I saw him, myself, but I didn&#8217;t ask
questions. So you can rest easy on that score. His
old man seemed to have no grudge against you for
it. Fact is, he scarcely allowed me time to warn him
of the Sioux before he told me you and a woman were
out and were liable to lose your scalps, if nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
worse. I think,&#8221; the lieutenant added, narrowing
upon me, &#8220;that you&#8217;ll find those Mormons are as just
as any other set, in a show down. The lad, I gathered
from the talk, drew on you after he&#8217;d cried
quits.&#8221; He turned hastily. &#8220;You spoke, madam?
Anything wanted?&#8221;</p>
<p>The trumpeter orderly plucked me by the sleeve.
He was a squat, sun-scorched little man, and his red-rimmed
blue eyes squinted at me with painful interest.
He whispered harshly from covert of bronzed
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg your pardon, sorr. Mrs. Montoyo, be it&mdash;that
lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From Benton City, sorr, ye say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From Benton City.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I know the name. It&#8217;s the same of a gambler
the vigilantes strung up last week; for I was
there to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard a gusty sigh, an exclamation from the
lieutenant. My Lady had fainted again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reaction, sir,&#8221; I apologized, to the lieutenant,
as we worked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; answered he. &#8220;You&#8217;ll both go back
to Benton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said I.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>STAR SHINE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was six weeks later, with My Lady all recovered
and I long since healed, and Fort Bridger pleasant in
our memories, when we two rode into Benton once
more, by horse from the nearest stage point. And
here we sat our saddles, silent, wondering; for of
Benton there was little significant of the past, very
little tangible of the present, naught promising of its
future.</p>
<p>Roaring Benton City had vanished, you might say,
utterly. The iron tendrils of the Pacific Railway
glistened, stretching westward into the sunset, and
Benton had followed the lure, to Rawlins (as had
been told us), to Green River, to Bryan&mdash;likely now
still onward, for the track was traveling fast, charging
the mountain slopes of Utah. The restless dust
had settled. The Queen Hotel, the Big Tent, the
rows of canvas, plank, tin, sheet metal, what-not
stores, saloons, gambling dens, dance halls, human
habitations&mdash;the blatant street and the station itself
had subsided into this: a skeleton company of hacked
and weazened posts, a fantastic outcrop of coldly
blackened clay chimneys, a sprinkling of battered
cans. The fevered populace who had ridden high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
upon the tide of rapid life had remained only as
ghosts haunting a potter&#8217;s field, and the turmoil of
frenzied pleasure had dwindled to a coyote&#8217;s yelp
mocking the twilight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all, all is wiped out, like he is,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
I wished to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All, all is wiped out, dear heart,&#8221; said I. &#8220;All of
that. But here are you and I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through star shine we cantered side by side eastward
down the old, empty freighting road, for the
railway station at Fort Steele.</p>
